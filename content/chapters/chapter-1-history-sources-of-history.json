      "content": "History is the systematic study of the past — events, people, societies, and changes over time. To understand the medieval period in India (roughly 9th to 18th century), historians depend on sources. Without sources, we cannot verify what actually happened. Four important factors guide historical study: Individuals (who acted), Society (the community involved), Place (where it happened), and Time (when it happened). All sources must be carefully examined for authenticity — a source can be forged, biased, or incomplete. A good historian cross-checks multiple sources before drawing conclusions.",

      "content": "Not all historical sources are equally reliable. Historians must critically evaluate every source before using it. Key questions to ask: Who created this source? When was it created? What was the purpose? Is the author a direct witness or writing much later? Is there a political or personal bias? Can it be verified by other independent sources? A source written by an enemy of a ruler may exaggerate their faults, while one written by a loyal minister may only praise them. Material sources like coins and inscriptions are generally more reliable as physical evidence. However, even material sources can be faked (forged coins existed in medieval India). Cross-referencing multiple types of sources — material, written, and oral — gives the most complete picture of the past.",
