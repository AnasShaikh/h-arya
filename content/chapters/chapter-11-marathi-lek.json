    "description": "A powerful Marathi poem celebrating the birth and value of a daughter. The poem uses rich metaphors: 'लेक तांबडं कुंदन, लेक हिरवं गोंदण / लेक झाडाची पालवी, लेक हाडाचं चंदन' — daughter is red gold, green tattoo, new leaf on a tree, and sandalwood from the bones. The poem also describes the daughter as the grandfather's inherited qualities and the grandmother's favourite. It ends with a powerful message of gender equality: 'मुलगा-मुलगी एकसमान, दोघांनाही द्या सन्मान' (Boy and girl are equal, give both respect). A chapter about values, poetry, and social equality."

In Maharashtra and across India, many families historically preferred sons — daughters were seen as a burden (because of dowry demands, perceived lower social value). This poem powerfully says: a daughter is not a burden — she is gold, a tattoo, a new leaf, sandalwood, the family's treasure. 'लेक' in Marathi can mean child generally, but in this context it means specifically daughter. The poem's message is: welcome and celebrate every daughter.",
