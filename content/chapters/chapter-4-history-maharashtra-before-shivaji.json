These foreign sultanates taxed the Maratha farmers heavily, often with arbitrary increases. Local Maratha chieftains (called Deshmukhs and Patils) had to serve these sultanates and collect taxes on their behalf. The sultanates also fought constant wars against each other and against the Mughal Empire, which caused great hardship to the common people of Maharashtra. The Mughals under Aurangzeb were also pressing southward, absorbing the Deccan kingdoms one by one.

Though Shahaji was a loyal servant of the Adilshahi, he had great ambitions and planted seeds of independence in the Deccan. He had a scholarly side too — he patronized poets and musicians.

Growing up in these hills made them natural warriors. Shivaji recognized the potential of these Mavale warriors and from his teenage years began building relationships with them. He treated them as equals, ate with them, played with them, and earned their fierce loyalty.

Shivaji grew up witnessing this situation — observing the suffering of farmers, the arbitrary taxation, the raids by jagirdars, and the disrespect shown to Maratha customs and religious sites. Jijabai's stories of heroic rulers who protected their people fanned the flame of Swaraj in young Shivaji's heart.
