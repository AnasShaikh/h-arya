    "description": "An inspiring story by Lakshmikamala Gedam (born 1956) about a 14-year-old student named Gopal who shows extraordinary bravery during a school picnic to Karnagad fort near Mohdi village, Nagpur. On the way back, the students encounter a dangerous wildfire (वणवा). When adults are helpless, Gopal jumps out of the bus, uses a rubber irrigation pipe to fight the fire, calls the fire brigade (101), and saves herders and animals. The chapter also revises Marathi parts of speech: noun (नाम), pronoun (सर्वनाम), adjective (विशेषण), and verb (क्रियापद)."
