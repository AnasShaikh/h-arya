It reminds readers that scientific success is often built on courage, discipline, and resilience rather than easy opportunity. His life story is therefore as important as his discoveries, because it inspires ordinary learners to attempt extraordinary goals.",

        "modelAnswer": "Faraday proved himself a good pupil by listening deeply, keeping detailed notes, and learning tirelessly from every experiment despite low status and minimal formal education. He transformed even routine lab work into learning opportunities. Davy, though brilliant, was not always a good mentor because jealousy and social bias sometimes made him dismissive of Faraday’s potential and unsupportive in critical moments. The contrast highlights that true mentorship needs generosity as well as knowledge.",

        "modelAnswer": "Faraday responded to discouragement with persistence, not resentment. Even when given difficult or discouraging assignments like reverse-engineering Bavarian glass, he worked hard and accepted failure as part of learning. Instead of giving up, he kept the glass as a reminder to stay determined during future challenges. This attitude turned setbacks into fuel for later breakthroughs.",

The generator concept enabled conversion of motion into electricity, forming the basis of large-scale power generation. His field concepts and magnetism-light insights later shaped electromagnetic theory, communication systems, and modern electronics.

        "modelAnswer": "His drawings were initially not accepted because they lacked mathematical formulation, which the scientific community expected for formal validation. This did not mean the observations were wrong; they were conceptually correct but not expressed in the accepted language of equations. Later, Maxwell translated Faraday’s ideas mathematically, proving their depth and accuracy. This shows that truth in science may appear before full formal representation.",
