      "content": "Medieval Maharashtra had a clearly defined social structure centered on caste and the joint family system. Joint families — where grandparents, parents, children, and sometimes uncles and their families all lived together in one household — were the norm. The family elders made important decisions, and younger members showed deference and respect. The caste system divided society into hereditary occupational groups: Brahmins (priests, scholars, administrators), Kshatriyas/Marathas (warriors, rulers), Vaishyas (merchants, traders), and Shudras (artisans, farmers, laborers). Further subdivisions existed within each caste. The Panchayat system governed village affairs — a council of village elders from different castes would settle disputes, manage village resources, and represent the community to the ruler's officials. The family and panchayat were the foundation of social stability in medieval Maharashtra.",

      "content": "Agriculture was the backbone of medieval Maharashtra's economy. The main crops grown were rice (in the Konkan coastal region), jowar and bajra (sorghum and millet — the staple food of the Deccan plateau), and wheat in suitable areas. Cotton was also grown and was important for the textile trade. Irrigation was carried out through traditional methods: wells (vihar) dug near fields, tanks (talav) that collected rainwater, and small weirs on rivers to divert water. The harvest season determined the rhythm of village life. Farmers relied on monsoon rains — good monsoons meant prosperity, poor monsoons meant hardship. Bullocks were essential for plowing, and farming tools were primarily made of iron by the village blacksmith. Agricultural surplus was used to pay taxes and traded in weekly village markets (bazaars) and larger town markets. The economy was primarily barter-based in rural areas, though coins were used in towns and for long-distance trade.",

Weavers were organized into guilds (samaj) that maintained quality standards and negotiated with merchants. Surat (in neighboring Gujarat) was the most important trade port in medieval India — goods from Maharashtra flowed through Surat to Arabia, Persia, East Africa, and Europe. The Konkan coast had its own smaller ports. Traders traveled on well-established trade routes across Maharashtra — the highway from Pune to Surat was a major commercial artery.

The purdah system (veiling and seclusion) was practiced in some sections of society, particularly among upper-class urban families influenced by Mughal and Sultanate customs. Most rural women did not observe strict purdah and participated actively in farming and household crafts. However, women had limited legal and property rights. Child marriage was common. Despite these constraints, several extraordinary women left their mark on history: Jijabai (Shivaji's mother), Tarabai (who led the Maratha resistance), and Ahilyabai Holkar (Holkar queen of Indore) who governed wisely and built temples across India. Bhakti saints like Janabai (Namdev's servant) and Bahinabai composed devotional poetry.
