In 'The Red-Headed League', Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson receive a visit from Mr Jabez Wilson, a red-haired shopkeeper. Wilson's assistant Spaulding showed him a newspaper advertisement: 'The Red-Headed League pays £4 per week to red-headed men who copy the Encyclopaedia Britannica from 10am to 2pm each day.' Wilson was hired and worked for 8 weeks, happily copying text. Then suddenly, one day, a notice was posted: 'The Red-Headed League is dissolved.' The League and its office had completely vanished! Wilson came to Holmes, puzzled and upset about losing his easy income.",

He also closely observes Spaulding (Wilson's assistant who found the advertisement) and notices his trouser knees are very dirty and worn — meaning Spaulding has been spending a lot of time on his knees, digging!

Clay became Wilson's assistant 'Spaulding' to gain access to Wilson's cellar (basement).
