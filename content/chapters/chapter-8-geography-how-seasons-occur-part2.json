        "question": "Which TWO factors together cause seasons on Earth?",
        "answer": "Seasons are caused by BOTH Earth's revolution around the Sun AND its tilted axis (23°30'). Without the tilt, all latitudes would receive the same amount of sunlight all year — no seasons!",

      },
      {
        "question": "Uttarayan is the period from _____.",
        "answer": "Uttarayan (uttara = north) is the period from December 22 to June 21 when the Sun appears to move northward on the horizon each day. Days get longer in the Northern Hemisphere during this period.",
        "source": "chapter_test_explanation"
      },
      {
        "question": "On June 21, perpendicular sunrays fall on _____.",
        "answer": "On June 21 (Summer Solstice), the North Pole tilts most toward the Sun. Perpendicular rays fall on the Tropic of Cancer (23°30' N). This gives the Northern Hemisphere its maximum heat — summer!",
        "source": "chapter_test_explanation"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a 'midnight sun'?",
        "answer": "On Summer Solstice (June 21), places in the Arctic Circle (66.5°N and beyond) get 24 hours of continuous daylight — the sun circles the horizon without setting. This is called the 'midnight sun' — seen in Norway, Finland, Alaska, etc.",
        "source": "chapter_test_explanation"
      },
      {
        "question": "On an equinox day, day and night are each _____.",
        "answer": "On equinox days (March 21 and September 23), the sun's perpendicular rays fall on the equator. The circle of illumination bisects all latitudes equally — everywhere on Earth gets exactly 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night.",

      {
        "question": "Australia's cricket season is in November–February because _____.",
        "answer": "Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere. When India has winter (December), Australia has summer — the opposite seasons. Their summer (Nov–Feb) is the warmest, driest period — perfect for outdoor cricket.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Even though Earth is closest to the Sun (perihelion) in January, the Northern Hemisphere has winter because _____.",
        "answer": "This is a very important concept! Earth is actually CLOSEST to the Sun in January (perihelion) but the Northern Hemisphere has winter because the North Pole tilts AWAY from the Sun, making sunrays more oblique and less intense. The tilt effect dominates over the distance effect.",

        "question": "Makar Sankranti (January 14) celebrates _____.",
        "answer": "Makar Sankranti celebrates the start of Uttarayan — when the Sun begins its apparent northward movement (which actually starts December 22). The January 14 date is when it becomes clearly observable that the Sun's sunrise position has moved northward.",
