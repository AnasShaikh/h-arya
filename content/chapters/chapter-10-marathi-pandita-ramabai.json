    "description": "A biographical chapter about Pandita Ramabai Sarasvati (1858–1922), one of India's greatest social reformers, educators, and early feminist thinkers. Born in Maharashtra, she learned Sanskrit from her father — unusual for women of that era. Widowed young, she devoted her life to educating women and child widows, founded the Mukti Mission in Kedgaon near Pune, wrote the groundbreaking book 'The High-Caste Hindu Woman,' and was the first Indian woman to receive the Kaisar-i-Hind medal. Her life story is a powerful lesson about courage, education, and social change."

Her father, Anant Shastri Dongre, was a remarkable man for his time — he believed that women should be educated just like men. Against the prevailing social norms, he taught his wife and his daughter Ramabai Sanskrit — the language of sacred texts, traditionally reserved for upper-caste men. The family was devout and travelled as pilgrims across India, visiting sacred sites. This early life of learning, travel, and strong values shaped Ramabai's extraordinary character. When her parents died during a famine, Ramabai and her brother walked thousands of miles as penniless pilgrims.",

Ramabai fought against this injustice. She established schools and residential institutions where widows could learn skills, read, and become self-reliant.
