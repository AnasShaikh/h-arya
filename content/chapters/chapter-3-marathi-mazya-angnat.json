    "description": "A beautiful Marathi poem by Dnyaneshwar Koli (1956–2019) that celebrates the joy of harvest in a farmer's courtyard. Wheat grains are compared to pearls scattered on black soil by moonlight. The five stanzas describe: the harvest spread like jewels, the community sharing in harmony, a mother's care for the tired worker, and birds pecking grain — followed by tears when they fly away. The poem is rich in agricultural imagery and introduces students to Marathi farming vocabulary and the emotional bond between farmer and land."
