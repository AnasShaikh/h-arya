He protected mosques, dargahs (Sufi shrines), and churches in his territory with the same vigor as he protected temples. His written orders (aadnyapatra) specifically instructed his soldiers to never damage mosques or harm Muslim clergy. He had many Muslim officers in his army — including Ibrahim Khan who commanded part of his artillery, and Siddi Ibrahim who served in his navy. He respected the Quran — when a copy was once brought to him as loot, he treated it with reverence and returned it. His Ashtapradhan included the Panditrao who managed religious affairs of all communities. Shivaji saw religious violence as not only morally wrong but also politically damaging — a ruler who respected all faiths earned loyalty from all subjects.",

When she was presented before Shivaji, he said: 'If my mother had been so beautiful, I would also have been handsome!'

The principle was clear: rich and poor, high caste and low caste, Hindu and Muslim — all were equal before the law. His Nyayadhish (Chief Justice) ensured that complaints from ordinary farmers received the same attention as those from nobles. Shivaji himself would sometimes attend to grievances personally. He punished soldiers who looted or misbehaved with civilians, regardless of their rank or past service. He punished his own kinsmen when they acted unjustly. One famous story: Shivaji received a complaint from a poor widow that his soldiers had damaged her crops. He investigated, found it was true, and compensated the widow — and punished the soldiers involved. This approach built fierce loyalty among the common people who had never experienced such just governance.",

He issued orders protecting forests — understanding that deforestation damaged water sources and farming. Wells were maintained and kept clean. Travelers and traders were protected on roads. Artisans and craftsmen were supported. He personally attended to complaints from farmers and ordinary people. His administrative letters show him concerned with practical details — whether granaries near forts were properly stocked, whether water cisterns were clean, whether market prices were fair.

Contemporary European observers — English East India Company officials who recorded the sacking of Surat — were astonished by the discipline of his army and his protection of non-combatants. Mughal officials, even enemies, recorded his fairness and courage with admiration. Bhakti saints like Tukaram praised him in poetry.
