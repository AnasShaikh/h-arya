        "modelAnswer": "In 'The Brook', Alfred Lord Tennyson uses the literary device of personification to give the brook human qualities. By writing the poem from the first-person perspective, the brook itself becomes the narrator, speaking directly to the reader. Words like 'chatter', 'babble', and 'murmur' assign human-like actions and a voice to the flowing water. This personification helps to emphasize the active, enduring nature of the brook in contrast to the short, temporary lives of human beings.",
