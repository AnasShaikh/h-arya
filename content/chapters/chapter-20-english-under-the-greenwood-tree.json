      "content": "William Shakespeare (1564–1616) is widely considered the greatest writer in the English language. He wrote 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and many poems. 'As You Like It' is one of his famous comedies, written around 1599. The play is set partly in the Forest of Arden, a magical place where characters who have been unfairly treated in court (real life) escape to live freely and honestly. 'Under the Greenwood Tree' is a song sung in this play by a character named Amiens. The song captures the play's central idea: the simple, free forest life is more joyful and honest than the complicated, corrupt life at court with all its ambition, politics, and competition.",

There are no human enemies — no jealousy, competition, backstabbing, false friends, or political rivals. The song paints a picture of a paradise where life is simple, honest, and free.

These are people who prefer honesty and simplicity over power and wealth. 'Doth' is the old English form of 'does'. So 'who doth ambition shun' = 'whoever avoids ambition'.

'Doth' means 'does' — 'who doth ambition shun' = 'who does shun ambition'. 'I'the' (or 'i' the) means 'in the' — a shortened, contracted form. These old words are called archaic words. Reading archaic language helps us understand what English sounded like centuries ago, and also helps us read Shakespeare's original texts more easily.

(2) The simple, natural life in the forest — free, honest, peaceful, with only nature's challenges (winter, rough weather). Shakespeare uses the greenwood tree as a symbol of freedom and natural happiness. The song suggests that true contentment comes not from wealth or power, but from living simply and honestly, in harmony with nature. This theme connects with many Indian philosophical traditions — the idea that the 'material world' causes suffering, and simplicity brings peace.

        "modelAnswer": "The old English word 'hither' simply means 'here' in modern English. In the song \"Under the Greenwood Tree\", the repeated phrase \"Come hither\" acts as a warm and enthusiastic invitation. It is an archaic word that Shakespeare used because he wrote the play over 400 years ago. Understanding such words helps us appreciate the original beauty of his poetry. For example, when someone says \"come hither,\" they are just inviting you to join them where they are.",
