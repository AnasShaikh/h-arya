        "question": "In which direction does the Earth rotate?",
        "answer": "The Earth rotates from west to east (anti-clockwise when viewed from the North Pole). This is why the sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west.",

        "answer": "The equinoxes — March 21 (Vernal Equinox) and September 23 (Autumnal Equinox) — are the two days when day and night each last exactly 12 hours everywhere on Earth.",

        "question": "The position of sunrise on the horizon is the same every day of the year.",
        "answer": "The position of sunrise on the horizon changes throughout the year. The sun rises due East only on the two equinoxes. At other times it rises north of east (summer) or south of east (winter) in the Northern Hemisphere.",

      {
        "question": "Why does the shadow position of the stick change from month to month?",
        "answer": "The changing position of the shadow reflects the changing position of sunrise/sunset on the horizon. This change is caused by Earth's revolution around the sun combined with its tilted axis — fully explained in Chapter 8.",
