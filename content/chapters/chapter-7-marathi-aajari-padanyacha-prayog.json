    "description": "A humorous Marathi story about a child who tries desperately to get sick so they can skip an upcoming exam. The child eats cold things, stands in the rain, stays up all night — but their body stubbornly stays perfectly healthy! The story ends with the child having to go to school and take the exam. The humour comes from the gap between the child's desperate efforts and the body's natural resilience. The chapter introduces grammar: शब्दयोगी अव्यये (Postpositions) — words used after nouns to show spatial or relational connections, like वर (on), खाली (under), जवळ (near), आत (inside)."

The child hatches a plan: get sick tonight, so that tomorrow's absence is completely justified! The 'experiment' begins: eating cold ice cream, drinking icy water, standing barefoot in the rain, sleeping near the open window, staying up all night. Despite all these determined efforts, the child wakes up the next morning completely healthy — rested, energetic, and with no choice but to go to school.
