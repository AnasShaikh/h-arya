        "modelAnswer": "A formal printed invitation is used for special official occasions like the inauguration of the 'Seeing Eyes, Helping Hands' project. It includes essential details such as the names of the organizers, the event title, the inaugurator, and the person presiding over the function.

        "question": "How does a written notice differ from a formal printed invitation?",
        "modelAnswer": "A written notice is a shorter and simpler form of an invitation compared to a formal printed card. It is usually displayed publicly on a school or office notice board to announce an event to students and staff. While it includes the core details like the event name, date, time, and venue, it lacks the detailed formalities and elaborate design of a printed card. A notice is signed by an authority figure like the Principal or a teacher to validate the information.",
