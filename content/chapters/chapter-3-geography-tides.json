        "question": "Why are there TWO high tides per day on opposite sides of Earth?",
        "answer": "Two forces create two bulges: Moon's gravity pulls water toward the Moon (one high tide), and the centrifugal force from Earth's rotation pushes water away on the opposite side (second high tide simultaneously).",

        "question": "Spring tides are HIGHER than usual because _____.",
        "answer": "On New Moon and Full Moon days, the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned. Both the Sun's and Moon's gravitational forces act in the same direction, creating a greater combined pull — resulting in higher than usual high tides (spring tides).",

      {
        "question": "Neap tides occur when _____.",
        "answer": "On Quarter Moon days, the Moon is at 90° to the Sun-Earth line. The Sun's and Moon's gravitational forces act at right angles — they partially cancel each other, resulting in smaller tidal range (neap tides).",

        "question": "The world's highest tidal range (~1600 cm) is found at _____.",
        "answer": "The highest tidal range in the world (~1600 cm = 16 metres!) is at the Bay of Fundy on the Atlantic coast of Canada/USA. India's highest is Gulf of Khambhat, Gujarat (~1100 cm).",

        "question": "Which of these is a use of tides?",
        "answer": "Tides have many uses: salt production (water fills salt pans at high tide), tidal energy generation, ships enter shallow ports at high tide, tides clean coastlines and keep ports free of sediment, and they support coastal ecosystems (mangroves).",

        "question": "The centrifugal force involved in tides acts _____.",
        "answer": "Centrifugal force acts away from the centre of rotation — in the direction opposite to gravitational force. It's this outward push (from Earth's rotation) that creates the high tide bulge on the side of Earth opposite to the Moon.",

Since there are two cycles per day, tides occur approximately every 6 hours 12 minutes — but the timing shifts 25 minutes later each day.
