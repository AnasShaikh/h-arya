Under Shahu Maharaj, the Peshwa effectively became the executive head of the Maratha government, while the Chhatrapati remained the ceremonial and symbolic head. The Peshwa's seat was at Pune (specifically Shaniwarwada, the famous Peshwa palace). This shift of effective power from Satara (the Chhatrapati's seat) to Pune (the Peshwa's seat) marked a fundamental transformation of the Maratha state. The Peshwas were Brahmin administrators of the Chitpavan community — highly educated, skilled in both administration and diplomacy.

He used alliances, diplomacy, and financial management to strengthen the Maratha position. His most significant achievement was the Treaty of 1719 with the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar — negotiated through masterful diplomacy after Maratha military victories. This treaty secured Shahu Maharaj's formal recognition as Chhatrapati, gave the Marathas the right to collect chauth (a quarter of revenue) from the Deccan, and recognized the Maratha territories. Balaji Vishwanath also reorganized Maratha finances, which had been strained by decades of war.

He never lost a single battle in his career — an extraordinary record. His strategic vision was expressed in one memorable phrase: 'Let us strike at the trunk (Delhi) — the branches will fall by themselves.' Rather than wastefully capturing and administering every individual region, Bajirao believed in striking at the center of Mughal power to break the empire's authority. His campaigns ranged from Gujarat to Malwa, Bundelkhand, and Rajputana. In 1737, Bajirao's cavalry appeared near Delhi itself — the Mughal emperor was terrified and could not protect his own capital. The Battle of Bhopal (1737) was a complete Maratha victory against the Mughal army. By the time Bajirao died at age 40 (1740), Maratha power extended across a vast portion of northern India.",

This expansion was not always through direct military conquest. Marathas collected 'chauth' (protection taxes) from territories they didn't directly administer. Regional chiefs often asked for Maratha help and in return accepted Maratha suzerainty. The Marathas also placed their commanders as governors in some regions.
