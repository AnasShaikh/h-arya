At the age of just 16, in 1645, Shivaji captured his first fort — Torna, near Pune — by gathering his loyal Mavale companions and outwitting the Adilshahi garrison with a daring night attack. This was not an act of rebellion yet in the open sense, but it was the first concrete step toward building Swaraj. With the treasure found at Torna, Shivaji began building Rajgad fort nearby. He then captured Kondana (later Sinhagad) and Rajgad. Each fort captured was another building block of the Swaraj.

The Adilshahi sultan sent his most powerful general, Afzal Khan, with a large army of over 10,000 to crush Shivaji. Afzal Khan was a huge, physically powerful man known for his cruelty — reportedly he killed two of his own wives before the campaign so they wouldn't remarry after his death. He desecrated the temple of Tuljabhavani on his way to provoke a reaction. Both sides agreed to a personal meeting near Pratapgad fort. Knowing the meeting could be a trap, Shivaji wore armor under his clothes and concealed a tiger-claw weapon (bagh nakh) and a dagger. At the meeting, Afzal Khan tried to stab Shivaji — Shivaji responded by disemboweling Afzal Khan with the bagh nakh. The Maratha army then attacked the confused Adilshahi army and routed them completely. The Battle of Pratapgad (November 10, 1659) was a landmark victory that established Shivaji as a major power.",

He surrounded many Maratha forts and convinced several Maratha chieftains to switch sides. Under enormous pressure, Shivaji was forced to negotiate. The Purandardar Treaty (1665) was signed: Shivaji gave up 23 forts to the Mughals, retained only 12 smaller ones, and agreed to send his son Sambhaji as a Mughal noble. In exchange, Shivaji was recognized as a noble and given the title 'Raja'.
