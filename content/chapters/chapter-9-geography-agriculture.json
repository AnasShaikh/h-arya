        "question": "In beekeeping, how do bees benefit crops beyond just producing honey?",
        "answer": "Bees carry pollen between flowers (pollination) as they collect nectar. This helps crops produce more fruits and seeds. Orchards near beehives get significantly better yields — making beekeeping an important allied agricultural activity.",

        "question": "In shifting cultivation, why do farmers move to a new area after 2-3 years?",
        "answer": "In shifting cultivation, farmers clear forest, plant crops in the ash-enriched soil. After 2-3 years, soil nutrients are exhausted and yields drop. Farmers then move to a new area, allowing the old land to regenerate for 15-20 years before farming it again.",

        "question": "Why is extensive grain farming done with large machines (tractors, combines) rather than manual labour?",
        "answer": "Extensive grain farms are 200+ hectares (sometimes thousands!) and are found in sparsely populated grassland regions (Prairies, Steppes). There aren't enough people to farm manually. Machines make it economically possible to cultivate vast areas with few workers.",

        "question": "Plantation agriculture differs from extensive grain farming because _____.",
        "answer": "Plantation agriculture grows commercial crops (tea, rubber, coffee, spices) in hilly areas requiring careful manual picking. Extensive grain farming grows food grains (wheat, corn) in flat temperate grasslands using heavy machinery.",

        "question": "Market gardening is also called 'truck farming' because _____.",
        "answer": "Market gardening produces perishable vegetables, fruits, and flowers that must reach city markets quickly. The entire enterprise depends on efficient truck transport — hence 'truck farming'. Quality and price depend on how fast the produce reaches the market.",

        "question": "What makes organic farming food healthier and more valuable?",
        "answer": "Organic farming uses natural inputs (vermicompost, compost, neem pesticide, cowdung). No chemical residues accumulate in the food or soil — making it healthier for consumers and sustainable for the environment. Organic produce commands premium prices in the market.",

        "question": "Give short answer: Describe the importance of irrigation for agriculture.",
        "modelAnswer": "Irrigation provides assured water supply when rainfall is insufficient, uneven, or uncertain. It protects crops from drought, supports timely sowing, and helps increase yield and cropping intensity. Reliable irrigation also enables cultivation of water-demanding crops and improves agricultural stability and income.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Assured water supply reduces dependence on uncertain rainfall.",
          "Prevents crop stress and failure during dry periods.",

        "question": "Give short answer: Give a comparative account of any two methods of irrigation.",
        "modelAnswer": "Canal irrigation carries water from rivers/reservoirs through channels to fields and is suitable for broad command areas, but it may involve high conveyance loss and heavy infrastructure. Drip irrigation delivers water directly near plant roots through pipes and emitters, saving water and reducing weed growth, but it requires initial investment and maintenance. Thus, canal systems suit large-scale distribution, while drip is highly efficient for water-scarce and horticultural settings.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Canal irrigation: large coverage, infrastructure-heavy, possible water loss.",
          "Drip irrigation: high water-use efficiency, targeted delivery, lower wastage.",
          "Canal suits extensive command areas; drip suits scarce-water/high-value crops.",

        "modelAnswer": "Major farming types include intensive, extensive, plantation, mixed, subsistence, commercial, shifting cultivation, and modern specialized forms such as organic farming. Intensive farming uses small landholdings with high labour and input use to produce maximum output per unit area. Extensive grain farming is practiced over very large farms with lower labour per unit area and high mechanization, typically for crops like wheat.",

          "Many farming types exist based on inputs, scale, and market orientation.",

Typical plantation crops include tea, coffee, rubber, cocoa, and coconut, usually grown in suitable tropical/subtropical climates.",

        "modelAnswer": "Agriculture in India is strongly influenced by monsoon rainfall, which is seasonal and uneven in timing and distribution. Many regions depend on rain-fed farming, so crop calendars align with rainfall periods. Perennial agriculture faces difficulties such as irrigation limitations, groundwater stress, variable climate, high input costs, and storage/market challenges for continuous production.",

          "Monsoon dependence makes agriculture season-bound in many regions.",
          "Rainfall variability affects sowing and crop reliability.",

Improved seeds, precision irrigation, mechanization, and scientific nutrient/pest management raise output and reduce losses. Technology also supports climate resilience, post-harvest efficiency, and stronger linkage with agro-industries and markets.",
