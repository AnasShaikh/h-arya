        "question": "Why does the same basalt rock form black soil in Deccan Plateau but laterite soil in Konkan?",
        "answer": "This is a key textbook point: the same parent rock (basalt) gives different soils in different climates. Dry Deccan → black soil. Heavy-rainfall Konkan → leaching removes minerals, iron oxidises → reddish-orange laterite soil.",

        "question": "Which soil type is most fertile and is best for rice cultivation in Maharashtra?",
        "answer": "Alluvial soil deposited by rivers is the most fertile — it contains fresh minerals from upper river areas. In Maharashtra, alluvial soil is found along Konkan coastal river mouths (e.g., Panvel-Uran area) and river valleys. It supports rice cultivation in Konkan.",

        "question": "What happens when chemical fertilizers are used excessively over many years?",
        "answer": "Excessive chemical fertilizers leave toxic residues that kill soil microorganisms. Without microorganisms, dead organic matter can't decompose — humus decreases. Without humus, soil fertility drops and plants don't get micronutrients. This is soil degradation.",

        "question": "What are Continuous Contour Trenches (CCTs)?",

        "question": "Why is it advisable to leave farmland fallow for some period?",

        "question": "Why does this occur: To the west of Sahyadris, laterite soils are formed from basalt rock?",
        "modelAnswer": "Although basalt is the parent rock, the western side of the Sahyadris receives very heavy rainfall and high humidity. Intense leaching under this climate removes silica and bases from the upper soil layers, leaving iron and aluminium-rich residues. Over long periods this process transforms weathered basalt into lateritic soils.",

          "Basalt is the parent material but climate controls soil outcome.",
          "Heavy rainfall causes intense leaching.",

        "modelAnswer": "Humus increases when plant and animal remains are added to soil and decomposed by microorganisms. Practices such as composting, use of organic manures, crop residue management, and reduced burning improve organic matter accumulation. Over time, decomposition converts this organic matter into humus, improving soil structure and fertility.",

Therefore rock breakdown and transformation into soil occur faster than in cold or dry regions.",
