        "question": "Why is the news about Miribaba's 'special powder' considered unreliable?",
        "modelAnswer": "The news claiming that Miribaba's 'special powder' can cure all diseases is considered highly unreliable because it lacks proper verification. Reliable news must always be supported by factual evidence, which is entirely missing in this case. Hospital data and medical professionals do not support or confirm any of Miribaba's extraordinary health claims. Therefore, this news is classified as an unverified and potentially dangerous fake claim rather than a credible medical breakthrough.",
