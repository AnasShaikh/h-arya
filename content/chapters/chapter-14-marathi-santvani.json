    "description": "The final chapter features two abhang (devotional poems) by great Maharashtra saints: (1) Sant Janabai (13th century) — a poem about motherly love using the image of birds feeding chicks, a mother monkey keeping her baby close, and comparing God (Vitthal) to a mother who always watches over us; (2) Sant Tukaram (17th century) — a poem warning against hypocrites (भोंदू) who put ash on their bodies but commit sins inside, pretend renunciation (वैराग्य) but enjoy worldly pleasures. The chapter also includes a Suvichar (motivational thought) about courage in facing adversity. It introduces the Abhang form and Maharashtra's Sant Parampara (saint tradition)."

Despite her humble social position, she was a devoted bhakta (devotee) of Vitthal (Lord Vishnu at Pandharpur) and wrote approximately 300 abhangs. Her abhang in this chapter uses three images of motherly love to describe God's protective care: (1) birds carrying food to their chicks in the nest, (2) a monkey (माकड) keeping her baby pressed against her belly even while jumping between trees, and (3) herself — comparing these natural mother-images to how Vitthal (God) constantly watches over and protects devotees.",
