      "content": "The Bhakti movement was one of the most transformative religious and social movements in medieval India (roughly 8th to 17th century). The word 'Bhakti' means devotion — the saints of this movement taught that the path to God is through sincere love and devotion, not through elaborate rituals, caste status, or priestly authority. Bhakti saints came from all walks of life — some were Brahmins, some were weavers, some were from lower castes — and they preached in the local languages of the people (Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi) rather than only in Sanskrit. This made their message accessible to everyone. The Bhakti movement directly challenged the rigid caste system and the idea that only upper-caste people could achieve spiritual liberation. It promoted the idea that God loves all people equally.",
