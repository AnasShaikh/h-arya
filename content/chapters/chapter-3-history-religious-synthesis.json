The word 'Bhakti' means devotion \u2014 the saints of this movement taught that the path to God is through sincere love and devotion, not through elaborate rituals, caste status, or priestly authority. Bhakti saints came from all walks of life \u2014 some were Brahmins, some were weavers, some were from lower castes \u2014 and they preached in the local languages of the people (Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi) rather than only in Sanskrit. This made their message accessible to everyone. The Bhakti movement directly challenged the rigid caste system and the idea that only upper-caste people could achieve spiritual liberation.
