        "question": "In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect deflects winds to the _____.",
        "answer": "Earth rotates west to east. This rotation causes a deflecting force (Coriolis effect) on moving air. In the Northern Hemisphere, this deflects winds to the RIGHT of their original direction. (Left in Southern Hemisphere.)",

        "answer": "Trade winds blow from the subtropical high pressure belt (25°–35°N) to the equatorial low pressure belt. Their original southward direction gets deflected to the right (Coriolis effect in N. Hemisphere), making them blow from northeast to southwest.",

        "answer": "The Southern Hemisphere is dominated by ocean south of 40°S — with no large land masses to obstruct the westerlies. They build up tremendous speed unhindered. In the Northern Hemisphere, continents (Europe, North America, Asia) break up and slow these winds.",

        "question": "Sea breeze blows from sea to land during the day because _____.",
        "answer": "Land heats up faster than sea during the day (land has lower specific heat capacity). Hot land air rises → low pressure over land. Cooler sea air (higher pressure) flows toward the low pressure over land = sea breeze.",

      {
        "question": "Land breeze blows from land to sea _____.",
        "answer": "At night, land cools much faster than the sea. The cooler land creates high pressure; the relatively warmer sea creates low pressure. Wind flows from high (land) to low (sea) = land breeze at night.",

        "question": "Westerlies blow from _____.",
        "answer": "Westerlies blow from the mid-latitude (subtropical) high pressure belt to the sub-polar low pressure belt. Due to the Coriolis effect, they blow from southwest to northeast in the N. Hemisphere and northwest to southeast in the S. Hemisphere — from the west overall.",

        "answer": "During the day, the valley floor heats up faster than mountain slopes. Hot valley air rises (low pressure), and cooler mountain air flows down to replace it — creating a valley breeze that blows FROM the mountain INTO the valley during daytime.",

        "question": "State one reason: A belt of calm exists near the equator.",
        "modelAnswer": "Near the equator, intense heating causes air to rise vertically, creating the equatorial low-pressure belt. Since air ascends rather than moving strongly across the surface, horizontal wind speed becomes weak. This zone of weak and variable surface winds is called the calm belt or doldrums.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Strong heating at equator makes air rise.",
          "Surface pressure is low and horizontal flow is weak.",

        "modelAnswer": "In the southern hemisphere, especially between 40°S and 60°S, winds blow over vast uninterrupted oceanic stretches with very little land friction. In contrast, similar winds in the northern hemisphere are interrupted by large continental landmasses, which reduce wind speed through friction and obstruction. Therefore southern hemisphere westerlies are generally faster.",

          "Southern mid-latitudes have large open oceans and low friction.",
          "Northern hemisphere has greater land obstruction/friction.",
          "Less friction allows stronger and faster winds in the south.",

        "question": "State one reason: Monsoon winds in summer come from the sea but retreating monsoon winds in winter come from land.",
        "modelAnswer": "In summer, land heats faster than sea and develops low pressure, so moist winds blow from sea to land (south-west monsoon). In winter, land cools faster and develops high pressure while the sea remains relatively warmer and lower in pressure, so winds reverse from land to sea (north-east/retreating monsoon). This seasonal pressure reversal causes the change in wind direction.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Land-sea differential heating changes pressure seasonally.",
          "Summer: low pressure over land draws winds from sea.",
          "Winter: high pressure over land drives winds seaward.",

        "modelAnswer": "Polar regions receive very little solar heat, so the air remains extremely cold and dense. Cold dense air sinks, creating persistent high-pressure conditions at the surface. Therefore both the Arctic and Antarctic regions are associated with polar high-pressure belts.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Low temperature makes polar air dense and heavy.",

        "modelAnswer": "Earth’s rotation causes the Coriolis effect, which deflects moving air from its straight path. Winds are deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. This deflection shapes global wind belts and cyclone circulation patterns.",

        "question": "Answer in short: Why do cyclonic winds blow in a circular manner?",
        "modelAnswer": "Cyclones form around low-pressure centers where surrounding air converges inward. As air moves toward the center, the Coriolis effect deflects its path, turning the flow into a spiral/circular pattern around the low-pressure core. Thus convergence plus earth’s rotation gives cyclones their circular circulation.",

          "Cyclones are low-pressure systems with inward-moving air.",

        "question": "Answer in short: State the reasons for formation of cyclones and describe their effects.",
        "modelAnswer": "Cyclones form when warm moist air over oceanic regions rises rapidly, creating a low-pressure center, while surrounding air rushes in and rotates due to the Coriolis effect. Condensation releases latent heat, which further intensifies the system. Cyclones bring very strong winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, flooding, coastal erosion, and serious damage to life, crops, houses, transport, and infrastructure.",
