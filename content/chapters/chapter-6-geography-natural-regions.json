        "question": "What determines which natural region an area belongs to?",
        "answer": "Natural regions are determined by the availability of sunlight and water (rainfall) at different latitudes. These factors create specific climates which support specific vegetation and animal life.",

      {
        "question": "The Prairies, Steppes, Pampas, Velds and Downs are all types of _____.",
        "answer": "All these are grasslands — the same type of natural region found on different continents at similar latitudes (25°–55°N/S interior of continents). Different names, same ecological characteristics: moderate rainfall, grass-dominated vegetation.",

        "question": "Inuit/Eskimo people live in _____.",
        "answer": "The Inuit (Eskimo) people live in the Tundra region — the extremely cold zone between 65°–90° N. They traditionally lived in igloos (ice houses), used sledges for transport, and survived by hunting and fishing.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why do desert plants like cactus have thick stems, small leaves, and oily/thick bark?",
        "answer": "Desert plants are specially adapted to save water: thick stems store water, small/no leaves reduce transpiration (water loss), and thick waxy bark prevents evaporation. Cactus can survive without rain for months using stored water.",

        "question": "Which natural region does most of India belong to?",
        "answer": "India lies between 10°–30° N — the monsoon region. It receives seasonal rainfall from the Southwest Monsoon and supports diverse crops (rice, wheat, cotton). India's agriculture, culture, and festivals are all deeply connected to the monsoon.",

        "question": "The Mediterranean region is unique because _____.",
        "answer": "The Mediterranean climate is famous for its dry, hot summers and mild, rainy winters — the exact opposite of the Monsoon region (rainy summer, dry winter). This pattern supports specific plants like olive and oak with thick, oily leaves adapted to dry summers.",

        "question": "The main occupation in the Taiga region is _____.",
        "answer": "The Taiga region has vast coniferous forests (spruce, fir, pine) with soft, light wood. Lumbering (cutting and processing timber) is the main occupation here. The timber is used for paper, furniture, and construction worldwide.",

        "question": "Why are carnivorous animals like lions and cheetahs mainly found in the Savanna (Sudan-type grassland) rather than dense forests?",
        "answer": "The open grassland habitat allows fast predators (lions, cheetahs) to use their speed to catch prey. Dense forests would favour stealth over speed. Evolution has shaped Savanna animals for the open habitat: zebra's stripes (camouflage), giraffe's height (to see predators), cheetah's speed.",

        "modelAnswer": "The monsoon region receives seasonal but substantial rainfall and generally has warm temperatures, both of which support crop cultivation. Many river plains and fertile soils in this region further favor farming. As water and climate conditions are suitable for a variety of crops, agriculture naturally becomes the dominant occupation.",

        "question": "Give geographical reason: Trees in equatorial forests grow tall.",
        "modelAnswer": "Equatorial regions receive heavy rainfall and high temperatures throughout the year, creating ideal conditions for rapid and continuous plant growth. Dense competition for sunlight in thick forests forces trees to grow vertically to reach light. As a result, equatorial forests are characterized by tall, multi-layered vegetation.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Year-round heat and rainfall support continuous growth.",
          "Dense forest competition drives trees upward for sunlight.",

        "question": "Give geographical reason: Vegetation is short-lived in the Tundra region.",
        "modelAnswer": "The Tundra has extremely low temperatures and a very short summer season, so the period available for plant growth is limited. Much of the ground remains frozen (permafrost), restricting root penetration and nutrient cycling. Therefore only short-lived, hardy vegetation like mosses, lichens, and small grasses can survive for brief periods.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Very cold climate and short summer shorten growing period.",
          "Permafrost limits root growth and soil development.",

        "modelAnswer": "Common herbivores of the Sudan (savanna) region include deer/antelope, zebra, and giraffe (others include elephant). Nature has equipped them with features such as high running speed, strong legs, keen senses, group movement behavior, camouflage colouring, and in some species horns or kicks for defence. These adaptations help them escape predators in open grasslands.",

        "modelAnswer": "The monsoon region is characterized by seasonal reversal of winds, with a wet season (rainy monsoon) and a relatively dry season. Temperatures are generally warm to hot, and rainfall is concentrated in specific months. Vegetation and agriculture are strongly seasonal, and human life is closely linked to monsoon timing and intensity.",
