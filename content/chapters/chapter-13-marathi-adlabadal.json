    "description": "A story by the famous Gujarati writer Pannalal Patel (1912–1989), translated into Marathi. Friends Amrut and Isab play Holi together with joy, while their friend Keshav hesitates to join because he is wearing beautiful new clothes and fears getting them stained. The story is about the meaning of true friendship — whether it can transcend differences of wealth, religion, and material possessions. 'अदलाबदल' means exchange or give-and-take — the foundation of true friendship is mutual giving, sharing, and trust. The story celebrates Holi as a festival that washes away differences and brings people together."

Born in a small village in Gujarat, he came from a humble background and wrote about rural life, friendship, and human values in language that was simple, warm, and deeply moving. His most famous novel 'Mane Ghana' (1944) won the Jnanpith Award — India's highest literary honour — in 1985. His stories celebrate ordinary people living with extraordinary love, friendship, and moral values. The story 'अदलाबदल' has been translated from Gujarati to Marathi, showing how Indian regional literatures enrich each other. The word 'अदलाबदल' perfectly captures his theme: the beautiful exchange (give-and-take) that makes true friendship possible.",

Friends give each other happiness; they take from each other support, understanding, and belonging.
