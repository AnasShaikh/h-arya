A good compere must speak clearly, be confident, smile, know the order of events, and use polite and respectful language.

        "modelAnswer": "\"Atithi Devo Bhava\" is a profound Sanskrit phrase from the ancient Taittiriya Upanishad that translates to \"Guest is God\". It forms a foundational principle of Indian culture, teaching that guests must be welcomed with the highest level of respect and honour.

        "modelAnswer": "The phrase \"butterflies in your stomach\" is a common idiom used to describe a nervous, fluttery physical sensation felt in the stomach. It typically occurs when a person is feeling highly anxious, nervous, or overly excited about an upcoming important event. A student compere might strongly experience this feeling just before walking onto the stage to address a large audience for the first time. Despite being an uncomfortable physical reaction, it is completely natural and often indicates that the person cares deeply about performing well.",

        "modelAnswer": "In English grammar, an object is the part of a sentence that receives the action of the verb. The direct object is the thing directly affected by the verb, answering the question \"what?\" or \"whom?\". The indirect object is the person to whom or for whom the action is done, answering \"to whom?\" or \"for whom?\". For example, in the sentence \"He gave me a pen\", \"pen\" is the direct object and \"me\" is the indirect object. Usually, the indirect object is placed immediately before the direct object in a sentence.",
