Also called an MC (Master of Ceremonies), the compere introduces speakers, announces events, keeps the programme running smoothly, and engages the audience. In a school function, a student compere plays a very important role — they are the link between the audience and the events on stage. A good compere must speak clearly, be confident, smile, know the order of events, and use polite and respectful language. In India, school comperes often introduce cultural programmes, sports days, and annual functions. The word 'compere' comes from the French word meaning 'godfather' — someone who guides and supports an event.",

In a school programme, this principle is shown through: escorting guests to their seats, garlanding the chief guest, lighting the lamp together, offering flowers or shawls as a mark of respect, and ensuring the guest is comfortable throughout. This is not just a phrase — it is a way of life in Indian culture. The famous Indian tourism tagline 'Incredible India' is also based on this Atithi Devo Bhava spirit of hospitality.",
