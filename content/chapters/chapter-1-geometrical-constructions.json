        "modelAnswer": "An angle bisector is a line or ray that divides a given angle into two equal parts. To draw one, you use a compass to mark arcs on the arms of the angle, then use those points to find an intersection point equidistant from both arms. Drawing a line from the angle's vertex through this intersection creates the bisector. This construction is essential for creating precise geometric figures where angles need to be accurately halved.",

        "modelAnswer": "A perpendicular bisector is a line that divides a line segment into two equal parts at a 90-degree angle. To construct it, place a compass point on one end of the segment and draw arcs above and below the line using a radius greater than half its length. Repeat this from the other endpoint without changing the radius to create two intersecting points. Drawing a straight line through these two points gives the perpendicular bisector.",

        "modelAnswer": "The property of the angle bisectors of a triangle is that they are concurrent, meaning all three bisectors intersect at a single common point. This specific point of concurrence is called the incentre and is denoted by the letter 'I'. The incentre is always located in the interior of the triangle, regardless of the triangle's shape. Furthermore, the perpendicular distances from the incentre to all three sides of the triangle are exactly equal.",

        "modelAnswer": "The perpendicular bisectors of all three sides of a triangle are concurrent, meaning they intersect at exactly one point. This point of concurrence is known as the circumcentre of the triangle and is typically denoted by the letter 'C'. The location of the circumcentre can be inside, outside, or on the triangle depending on whether it is acute, obtuse, or right-angled. A key property is that the distance from the circumcentre to each of the triangle's three vertices is equal.",

        "question": "How can you verify that a drawn line is the perpendicular bisector of a given line segment?",
        "modelAnswer": "To verify a perpendicular bisector, you must check two specific conditions at the point where it intersects the line segment. First, measure the angle formed at the intersection using a protractor; it must be exactly 90 degrees. Second, measure the length of the two segments created on the original line using a ruler or compass; they must be perfectly equal. If both the angle is right and the lengths are equal, the line is verified as a true perpendicular bisector.",
