We cannot see atoms with the naked eye, but when crores of atoms come together, their total volume is large enough to be visible to our eyes. The smallest particles of substances are molecules.

When the initial letter in the names of two or more elements is the same, a pair of letters is used to write the symbol. Elements generally classified into two groups: metals and non-metals. Elements occur in solid, liquid or gaseous state. Some metals are difficult to use in pure form. The properties of the original metal can be modified by mixing one or more elements in it.
