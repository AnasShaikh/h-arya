        "modelAnswer": "The lion is powerful and feared, but he is also capable of fairness and moral judgment. The fox is clever but manipulative, using intelligence for selfish ends. The leopard appears loyal at first but reveals opportunism when food and danger are involved. The vulture is sharp-eyed and practical, yet driven by greed and self-preservation. In contrast, the camel is innocent, trusting and genuinely loyal; his honesty finally earns the lion’s protection. Through these contrasting characters, the story highlights the difference between cunning and true goodness.",

        "modelAnswer": "Being king means having power, command and status. However, power alone does not make a ruler worthy. In the story, the lion’s greatness appears not in his strength but in his decision to protect the camel and expose false courtiers. His kindness is not weakness; it is ethical leadership.

Instead of offering himself, he respectfully says that true loyalty is proved by service, not speeches. The lion asks each courtier to perform a difficult duty for the kingdom. The vulture refuses, the fox escapes, and the leopard hesitates. The camel alone helps the injured lion return safely and serves him patiently. The lion then appoints the camel as chief companion and reforms the court rules so that honesty is valued above flattery.",
