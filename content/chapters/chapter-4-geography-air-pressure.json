Anything with weight exerts pressure on what lies below it. The entire column of atmosphere above us exerts pressure on Earth's surface — this is called air pressure (atmospheric pressure). Air pressure creates various weather phenomena like storms and precipitation. The unit for measuring air pressure is millibar (mb) or hectopascal (hPa).",

Air also becomes thinner (less dense) at high altitudes. (2) Temperature: Hot air expands, becomes lighter, and rises — leaving less air near the surface, so pressure decreases. Cold air is heavier, sinks, and creates higher pressure. The flying lantern experiment demonstrates this: hot air inside the lantern rises, lifting it up.",
