He invaded India multiple times — some estimates say between 7-9 invasions. His invasions caused tremendous devastation: looting Delhi (1757), massacring thousands at Mathura and Vrindavan (sites sacred to Hindus), taking enormous amounts of wealth back to Afghanistan. The Mughal Empire, weakened by Aurangzeb's Deccan wars, could not resist Abdali. The Afghan invasions threatened to establish permanent Afghan control over North India. The only major power capable of effectively opposing Abdali was the Marathas.

      "content": "Understanding why the Marathas lost at Panipat is important for historical analysis. Several key factors contributed: Failure of diplomacy — the Marathas failed to secure alliances with Rajputs, Jats, and Sikhs who resented Maratha tax collection. These groups either stayed neutral or aided Abdali. Supply problems — the Maratha army had marched deep into North India and its supply lines were overstretched; before the battle, the army was reportedly short of food and fodder. Loss of mobility — the Maratha army at Panipat adopted a conventional battle formation with artillery and families — losing the speed and flexibility that was their strength. Abdali's superior artillery and the coordination of his allied forces proved decisive. Internal divisions — the Maratha commanders did not always coordinate well. The presence of families and non-combatants burdened the army. The battle demonstrated that Maratha guerrilla strengths were not fully adapted for large-scale conventional battles far from home territory.",

Despite poor health (he suffered from tuberculosis throughout his life), Madhavrao rebuilt Maratha power with remarkable speed and energy. Within a decade of Panipat, Maratha armies were again operating across North India, defeating the Nizam, reasserting control over the Maratha confederacy, and reestablishing the empire's reputation. Madhavrao's administrative and military genius was extraordinary — he reorganized finances, disciplined the army, resolved internal disputes in the confederacy, and restored the Maratha empire's prestige.
