        "modelAnswer": "In the poem, the poet uses various literary devices to enhance the imagery and meaning. A simile is used when the poet asks, \"What the past is like to thee?\", directly comparing the past to the child's perspective. Metaphors are central to the poem, as the past is compared to an autumn evening, the present to a flowery spray, and the future to a dazzling sea. Alliteration is seen in phrases like \"smiling child\" and \"sea beneath a cloudless sun\", where the repetition of consonant sounds adds a musical quality. These devices beautifully illustrate the child's feelings about different stages of time.",

        "question": "How does the poet use punctuation marks like the full stop, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark to guide the reader?",
        "modelAnswer": "Punctuation in the poem serves to control the rhythm, tone, and dialogue structure between the poet and the child. Question marks are used at the end of the poet's inquiries, such as \"What the past is like to thee?\", inviting the reader into the conversation. Commas provide short pauses that help regulate the pace, especially in descriptive lists like \"A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea\". Full stops mark the end of a thought or stanza, giving the reader a moment to reflect on the imagery. While exclamation marks, hyphens, and dashes can indicate strong emotions or abrupt shifts, the poem primarily relies on questions and descriptive pauses to build its contemplative mood.",

          "Question marks signal the poet's inquiries to the child.",

        "question": "Explain the concepts of antonyms and homonyms, providing examples relevant to the context of the poem.",
        "modelAnswer": "Antonyms are words with opposite meanings, which help to create contrast and emphasize different stages of life. In the context of the poem, central antonyms include \"Past\" and \"Future\", as well as implied contrasts like \"soft\" versus harsh or \"mournfully\" versus joyfully. Homonyms are words that share the same spelling or pronunciation but have different meanings. For instance, the word \"spray\" in the poem refers to a small branch of flowers, but it can also mean a fine mist of liquid. Understanding these linguistic elements enriches the reader's appreciation of the poet's precise vocabulary choices.",

        "question": "Discuss how Onomatopoeia and Consonance are used to enhance the poem's mood.",
        "modelAnswer": "The poet employs sound devices to convey the specific emotions associated with different times of life. Onomatopoeia occurs when a word's sound mimics its meaning, such as the word \"sighs\" which imitates the sound of a gentle, mournful wind. Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds within or at the end of words, like the repeated \"s\" and \"z\" sounds in \"glorious, dazzling sea\". This repetition creates a sense of fluid movement and vastness, reflecting the excitement and limitless nature of the future. Together, these devices ensure that the poem's rhythm perfectly matches the natural elements being described.",

          "Onomatopoeia is used in words like \"sighs\" to mimic natural sounds.",
          "Consonance involves the repetition of internal or ending consonant sounds.",

        "question": "How does Emily Brontë use nature imagery to represent the Past, Present, and Future?",
        "modelAnswer": "Emily Brontë employs distinct nature metaphors to illustrate the passage of time, shifting from nostalgia to preparation and finally to boundless excitement. The Past is represented as an \"Autumn evening soft and mild\", suggesting a collection of pleasant memories tinged with gentle sadness. The Present is portrayed as a \"green and flowery spray\" where a young bird gathers its power, symbolizing a vital time of growth and preparation. Finally, the Future is described as a \"mighty, glorious, dazzling sea\" under a \"cloudless sun\", representing the thrilling and infinite possibilities that await. By linking time to the natural world, the poet suggests that life's stages are as beautiful and inevitable as the changing seasons.",
