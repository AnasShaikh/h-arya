        "modelAnswer": "The camel is called the 'Ship of the desert' due to its multiple adaptations for surviving and traveling in harsh desert conditions. It has long legs with flat and cushioned soles that prevent it from sinking into hot sand. Its skin is thick to reduce water loss, and it has long, thick eyelashes and nostrils that can be closed with folds of skin to protect against blowing sand. These features allow it to navigate the desert efficiently where other animals cannot.",

        "question": "How can plants like cactus and acacia live in deserts with scarce water?",
        "modelAnswer": "Desert plants like cactus and acacia have adapted to minimize water loss and maximize storage. Their leaves are either absent, very small, or modified into spines, which significantly reduces transpiration. Their stems are green and perform photosynthesis, and they become fleshy to store water. Additionally, their roots penetrate deep into the soil or spread wide to absorb any available moisture from a large area.",

        "question": "Explain the inter-relationship between adaptations of organisms and their surroundings.",
        "modelAnswer": "Adaptation is the process of gradual changes in the body parts and behavior of organisms that help them adjust to their surroundings. The specific environment, such as climate, food availability, and predators, determines which traits are beneficial. For instance, aquatic plants have air spaces in stems for buoyancy, while snowy region trees are conical to shed snow. This relationship ensures that organisms are best suited to survive and reproduce in their specific habitats.",

          "Adaptation is a gradual change for survival in a specific environment.",
          "Environmental factors like temperature and habitat drive these changes.",

        "modelAnswer": "Penguins have several physical and behavioral adaptations for polar life. Their skin is thick with a layer of fat (blubber) underneath for insulation against the extreme cold. They have a spindle-shaped body and webbed toes which make them excellent swimmers. Behaviorally, they live in large flocks and stick close to each other (huddling) to share body heat and protect themselves from freezing winds and predators.",

The hierarchy consists of several levels: Kingdom, Phylum (animals) or Division (plants), Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species.
