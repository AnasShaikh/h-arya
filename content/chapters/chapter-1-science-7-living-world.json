        "modelAnswer": "The camel is called the 'Ship of the desert' because of its remarkable adaptations to the harsh desert environment. It has long legs with flat and cushioned soles which help it walk easily on hot, loose sand without sinking. Its nostrils are protected by folds of skin, and it has long, thick eyelashes to keep out sand during storms. Additionally, its thick skin prevents water loss, and it can survive for long periods without water, making it the most reliable mode of transport in deserts.",

        "question": "How can plants like cactus and acacia live in deserts with scarce water?",
        "modelAnswer": "Desert plants like cactus and acacia are adapted to conserve water. Their leaves are either absent, very small, or modified into spines, which significantly reduces water loss through transpiration. The stem performs photosynthesis in the absence of leaves and becomes fleshy to store water. Furthermore, their roots penetrate deep into the soil or spread wide to absorb even the slightest amount of available moisture.",

        "question": "What is the inter-relationship between adaptations of organisms and their surroundings?",
        "modelAnswer": "Adaptation is a gradual process where changes occur in the body parts and behavior of organisms to help them survive, reproduce, and maintain their existence in a specific environment. The surroundings (climate, food availability, predators) dictate the type of adaptations needed. For example, animals in snowy regions have thick fur for insulation, while desert animals have adaptations to conserve water. This relationship ensures that organisms are best suited to thrive in their particular habitat.",

        "question": "How are organisms classified?",
        "modelAnswer": "Organisms are classified using a hierarchical system developed by Carl Linnaeus. This system, known as biological classification, groups living things based on their similarities and differences. The hierarchy consists of levels: Kingdom, Phylum (for animals) or Division (for plants), Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. Additionally, the Binomial Nomenclature system gives each organism a unique two-part scientific name consisting of its Genus and Species (e.g., Mangifera indica for mango).",

        "question": "Why do penguins live in flocks sticking close to each other?",
        "modelAnswer": "Penguins live in the extremely cold polar regions. They live in flocks and stick close to each other primarily to conserve body heat. By huddling together, they reduce the total surface area exposed to the freezing wind and snow, thereby sharing warmth and increasing their chances of survival in sub-zero temperatures. It also provides protection against predators.",
