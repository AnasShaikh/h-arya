      {
        "question": "Various shades of colour are seen in the sky at sunrise and sunset due to _____.",
        "answer": "At sunrise and sunset, sunlight travels a greater distance through the atmosphere. More blue light gets scattered, allowing red-yellow light to reach us directly.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Space beyond earth's atmosphere appears dark because _____.",
        "answer": "Without atmosphere, there are no particles to scatter light. We see light only when scattered rays enter our eyes.",

      },
      {
        "question": "We are able to read while sitting in the shade because of _____.",

      },
      {
        "question": "We should not observe the solar eclipse with naked eyes because _____.",

      {
        "question": "What is meant by scattering of light?",
        "answer": "Scattering occurs when light rays hit tiny particles (like molecules in air or milk in water) and scatter in different directions.",

      },
      {
        "question": "The shadow of a bird flying high is not seen on the earth because _____.",
        "answer": "When an object is small compared to the light source and very far from the screen (earth), its shadow becomes too small to be visible.",
