They read every book they can find, visit the library regularly, stay up late reading, and are transported to new worlds through books. Parents are initially worried but eventually support the habit when they see its positive effects. The story celebrates the joy and transformative power of reading. Grammar focus: उभयान्वयी अव्यये (Conjunctions) — words that join words, phrases, or sentences together, with four types: additive (आणि), adversative (पण), alternative (किंवा), and causal (कारण/म्हणून)."

      "Students often confuse कारणबोधक conjunctions — 'कारण' (because) introduces the REASON while 'म्हणून' (therefore) introduces the RESULT. Both show cause-effect but from different directions.",
      "Some students think 'व' (and) is not a valid conjunction — it is a formal alternative to 'आणि' and is correct in written Marathi.",
      "'तरी' (still/yet/even then) is sometimes missed as a conjunction — it is a न्यूनत्वबोधक used to show unexpected continuation despite a previous statement.",
      "Students may confuse शब्दयोगी अव्यये (postpositions, come after nouns) with उभयान्वयी अव्यये (conjunctions, join sentences)."
