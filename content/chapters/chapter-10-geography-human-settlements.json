        "question": "Which of these is a classic example of a linear settlement?",

        "question": "When does a rural settlement transform into an urban settlement?",
        "answer": "The transformation from rural to urban happens gradually as: more people arrive, secondary industries (manufacturing) develop, tertiary services (education, healthcare, trade, administration) expand, and the population grows significantly.",

Religion and historical significance are Cultural factors.",

        "modelAnswer": "Rivers provided the perfect combination for settlement: water for drinking and irrigation, fertile alluvial soil deposited by floods for farming, and water transport for trade. This is why all ancient civilisations began along rivers. This can be observed in standard textbook examples from this chapter.",

        "modelAnswer": "Scattered settlements have few houses and small populations spread over large areas. It's not economically viable to set up a school, hospital, or market for just 10-15 families. They depend on the nearest large village for these services. This can be observed in standard textbook examples from this chapter.",

        "question": "Why are nucleated settlements common in deserts like Rajasthan?",
        "modelAnswer": "In deserts where water is scarce, the few reliable water sources (wells, step-wells, oases) become focal points for settlement. Everyone must live close to the water source — naturally creating a clustered/nucleated settlement pattern. This can be observed in standard textbook examples from this chapter.",
