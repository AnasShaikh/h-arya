      "content": "The chapter begins with a wise quote from Benjamin Disraeli, the famous British Prime Minister: 'Nature gave us two ears and one mouth — we should listen twice as much as we speak.' The message is clear: we should listen more and speak less. Our ears are always open — they have no doors, no off switch. They are like funnels, always receiving sounds and information. But our mouths need to be controlled. Before speaking, words must pass through two 'fences' — the teeth and the lips. This is a beautiful metaphor meaning that we should pause and think before the words come out. The chapter encourages children to be good listeners — a skill that is just as important as speaking.",

The teacher told him: write down all the harsh things you said on a piece of paper, then tear the paper into small pieces and throw them into the wind. The young man did this. Then the teacher said: now go and collect all the pieces. Of course, it was impossible — the pieces had scattered in the wind. The teacher's lesson: just as you cannot collect scattered paper pieces, you cannot take back harsh words once spoken. They go out into the world and hurt people, and no apology can completely undo that hurt. This is why we must think carefully before we speak.",

Before speaking, ask yourself three questions: (1) Is it TRUE? — Does it contain accurate, verified information? (2) Is it PLEASANT? — Will it make the listener feel good, or will it cause hurt? (3) Is it USEFUL? — Does saying this serve a good purpose? If what you are about to say fails all three tests — if it is not true, not pleasant, and not useful — then do not say it at all.

Instead, he gave him a practical experience: write, tear, throw — and then try to collect. The impossible task of collecting scattered paper made the lesson unforgettable. The young man realised that words, once released, are beyond our control. The lesson for all of us: anger is temporary, but the damage caused by words spoken in anger can last a long time.

        "modelAnswer": "Nature has endowed us with two physical barriers to guard our speech: the teeth and the lips. Before a word can be spoken, it must pass through the 'fence' of teeth and the 'fence' of lips. This anatomical arrangement serves as a reminder that we should pause and think before allowing words to escape. By having these two fences, nature suggests that speaking should be a deliberate act rather than a hasty one, emphasizing the importance of self-control.",

        "modelAnswer": "The spiritual teacher asked a young man to write his harsh words on paper, tear it into pieces, and scatter them in the wind. When the young man was later told to collect all the pieces, he found it impossible as they had blown away in all directions. The teacher explained that spoken words are exactly like those scattered pieces of paper. Once harsh words are released, they go out into the world and can never be fully taken back, regardless of how much we might regret them later.",

        "question": "What are Socrates' three questions, and how do they help us decide when to speak?",
        "modelAnswer": "Socrates proposed a three-filter test to determine if something is worth saying: 'Is it true?', 'Is it pleasant?', and 'Is it useful?'. The first filter ensures we do not spread rumors, the second encourages kindness to avoid causing unnecessary hurt, and the third ensures our speech serves a practical purpose. If a statement fails these tests—if it is not true, not kind, and serves no purpose—Socrates advised that it is better left unspoken. This system helps us become more responsible and mindful communicators.",

        "question": "What is the meaning of the proverb: 'Of the unspoken word you are master, of the spoken word you are a slave'?",
        "modelAnswer": "This proverb highlights the power of self-control in communication. As long as a thought remains unexpressed, you retain full authority (mastery) over it and can choose to keep it private or modify it. However, once those words are uttered, they belong to the listeners and the world, and you become bound (a slave) by their consequences. This shift emphasizes that we must be extremely careful with our speech because we cannot undo the impact of what we have already said.",

        "question": "Why does the chapter compare our ears to funnels, and what lesson does this comparison teach?",
        "modelAnswer": "The chapter compares our ears to funnels to illustrate that they are always open and receptive to the world, with no 'doors' or 'fences' to shut out sound. Unlike the mouth, which can be closed by the lips and teeth, the ears are designed to constantly receive information. This comparison teaches us that nature intended for humans to be constant listeners and learners. It reinforces the wisdom of Benjamin Disraeli, who suggested we should listen twice as much as we speak.",

        "question": "Why is it said that even a sincere apology cannot fully undo the damage of harsh words?",
        "modelAnswer": "While an apology is necessary after saying something hurtful, it cannot completely erase the emotional impact of the harsh words. Just as the spiritual teacher's scattered paper could not be fully recovered, a hurtful comment remains in the listener's memory even after we say sorry. The damage to a person's feelings or a relationship often lingers long after the moment of anger has passed. Therefore, the best course of action is to think before speaking to avoid causing damage that an apology cannot entirely fix.",
