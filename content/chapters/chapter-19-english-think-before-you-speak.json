      "content": "The chapter begins with a wise quote from Benjamin Disraeli, the famous British Prime Minister: 'Nature gave us two ears and one mouth — we should listen twice as much as we speak.' The message is clear: we should listen more and speak less. Our ears are always open — they have no doors, no off switch. They are like funnels, always receiving sounds and information. But our mouths need to be controlled. Before speaking, words must pass through two 'fences' — the teeth and the lips. This is a beautiful metaphor meaning that we should pause and think before the words come out. The chapter encourages children to be good listeners — a skill that is just as important as speaking.",

The teacher told him: write down all the harsh things you said on a piece of paper, then tear the paper into small pieces and throw them into the wind. The young man did this. Then the teacher said: now go and collect all the pieces. Of course, it was impossible — the pieces had scattered in the wind. The teacher's lesson: just as you cannot collect scattered paper pieces, you cannot take back harsh words once spoken. They go out into the world and hurt people, and no apology can completely undo that hurt. This is why we must think carefully before we speak.",

Before speaking, ask yourself three questions: (1) Is it TRUE? — Does it contain accurate, verified information? (2) Is it PLEASANT? — Will it make the listener feel good, or will it cause hurt? (3) Is it USEFUL? — Does saying this serve a good purpose? If what you are about to say fails all three tests — if it is not true, not pleasant, and not useful — then do not say it at all.

The young man used harsh words against a friend in a moment of anger. He regretted it and went to his spiritual teacher. The teacher did not lecture him with long speeches. Instead, he gave him a practical experience: write, tear, throw — and then try to collect. The impossible task of collecting scattered paper made the lesson unforgettable. The young man realised that words, once released, are beyond our control. The lesson for all of us: anger is temporary, but the damage caused by words spoken in anger can last a long time.
