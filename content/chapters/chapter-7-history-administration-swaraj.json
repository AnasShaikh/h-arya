Central to this was the Ashtapradhan — a council of eight ministers, each responsible for a specific domain of governance. The eight ministers were: 1) Peshwa — Prime Minister, head of overall administration; 2) Amatya (also called Mazumdar) — Finance Minister, in charge of revenue and accounts; 3) Sachiv (also called Shurnavis) — Secretary, kept official records; 4) Mantri (also called Waqenavis) — Council Minister, informed the king of daily events; 5) Senapati (also called Sarnobat) — Commander-in-Chief of the Army; 6) Sumant (also called Dabir) — Foreign Minister, handled diplomatic relations; 7) Nyayadhish — Chief Justice, head of the judicial system; 8) Panditrao (also called Danadhyaksha) — Chief Religious Officer, responsible for religious matters and charity.

      "content": "Before Shivaji, Maharashtra's farmers were devastated by the tax-farming system — where wealthy middlemen would pay the sultan upfront for the right to collect taxes from a region, and then extort as much as possible from farmers to make a profit. Shivaji abolished this exploitative system. His revenue system was based on Ryotwari — direct settlement with the farmers. Land was surveyed, soil quality was assessed, and a fair tax was calculated based on the actual harvest potential. This assessment was called 'bigha' or 'chavdi.' During famines or bad harvests, taxes were reduced or waived entirely. Farmers who had fled their land because of previous oppression were invited back with incentives. The goal was a prosperous farming community — because agricultural prosperity was the foundation of the kingdom's economy. Shivaji's revenue minister, Annaji Datto, carried out systematic land surveys for fair assessment.",

He constructed a fleet of warships and sea forts (like Sindhudurg and Vijaydurg) to protect the Konkan coastline from sea attacks. Kanhoji Angre later became the most famous admiral of the Maratha navy.

Protection of farmers — they were seen as the foundation of the kingdom and needed to be prosperous for the state to survive. Respect for all religions — mosques, churches, and temples were all protected; religious scholars of all faiths were respected. Strict discipline for soldiers — no looting, no harassing civilians, no disrespecting women. Administrative transparency — each official was accountable through the system.
