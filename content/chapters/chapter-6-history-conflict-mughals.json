Shaista Khan occupied Pune and made his headquarters in the Lal Mahal — the very palace where Shivaji had spent his childhood. He began systematically raiding Maratha villages and damaging the economy. Shivaji planned a daring counter-strike. In April 1663, on the night of a wedding celebration (when security was relaxed), Shivaji and a small band of men infiltrated the heavily guarded Lal Mahal in Pune. In the darkness and confusion, Shivaji found Shaista Khan's chamber and wounded him — cutting off three of his fingers as he escaped through a window. Shaista Khan fled Pune in humiliation, never to return. This audacious raid showed Shivaji's personal bravery, strategic brilliance, and psychological understanding of his enemies.",

Controlling or disrupting Surat had massive financial and political implications. Shivaji sacked Surat in 1664 and again in 1670. The sackings had multiple purposes: they funded the Maratha war machine, they demonstrated that the Mughals could not protect even their richest city, and they psychologically shook Mughal prestige. Importantly, Shivaji specifically protected the English, Dutch, and other foreign traders during the sackings — choosing to target only Mughal officials and wealthy merchants who collaborated with the Mughal state. This showed sophisticated diplomacy — avoiding conflict with European powers while striking at Mughal economic interests.

Jai Singh was strategically brilliant. He avoided open battle with Shivaji and instead systematically isolated him — surrounding key forts, cutting off supplies, and using diplomacy to convince several Maratha sardars to switch allegiance. With many of his important forts surrounded and allies defecting, Shivaji was isolated. He agreed to negotiate. The Purandardar Treaty (June 1665) required Shivaji to: surrender 23 of his 35 forts to the Mughals, retain only 12 forts, pay a large indemnity, send his son Sambhaji to serve in the Mughal army, and personally appear at Aurangzeb's court.

Shivaji publicly protested, creating a scene in the imperial court. An angry Aurangzeb placed Shivaji under house arrest in Agra, with the implicit threat of execution. Shivaji and his son Sambhaji were surrounded by guards and seemed trapped. Over several weeks, Shivaji feigned serious illness and began sending large baskets of sweets to holy men as religious charity. When the guards became accustomed to the baskets leaving, Shivaji and Sambhaji hid inside and were carried out.

      "content": "Shivaji's military genius was most evident in his development and use of guerrilla warfare — known in Marathi as 'ganimi kava.' Rather than confronting the vastly larger Mughal armies in open battle where numbers would determine the outcome, Shivaji exploited the terrain of the Western Ghats. Key elements of ganimi kava: attacking suddenly from hidden positions, retreating quickly before the enemy could organize a response, using knowledge of local terrain (forests, hills, river valleys) that the enemy didn't have, striking at supply lines and communication routes rather than main armies, using spies and intelligence networks extensively. This approach neutralized the Mughal advantage in numbers, equipment, and cavalry on the plains. The Maratha soldiers were lightly armed and fast-moving — their speed was their armor. Ganimi kava proved so effective that the Mughals, despite their overwhelming size, could never achieve a decisive victory against the Marathas. After Shivaji's death in 1680, his successors continued this strategy to exhaust Aurangzeb's 27-year Deccan campaign.",

        "answer": "Ganimi kava refers to guerrilla warfare tactics — fighting through surprise attacks, quick retreats, use of local terrain knowledge, and striking at supply lines rather than engaging in open battle.

        "question": "Why was Jai Singh's military strategy against Shivaji more effective than previous Mughal generals?",
        "answer": "Jai Singh's genius was avoiding open battle (where the terrain favored Marathas) and instead isolating Shivaji through a combination of siege warfare around key forts and diplomacy to convince Maratha sardars to defect. This strategy was far more effective than previous Mughal frontal attacks.",

        "question": "What role did Shivaji's spy network play in his success?",
        "answer": "Shivaji had a sophisticated intelligence and spy network. Advance warning of Afzal Khan's treacherous intentions allowed Shivaji to prepare the bagh nakh. Intelligence about Shaista Khan's lax security during the wedding allowed the night raid. Information gathering was central to his military success.",

        "question": "Which of the following best describes why Shivaji chose guerrilla warfare over open battle?",
        "answer": "The Mughal army was vastly larger with superior cavalry on plains. In open battle, Shivaji would lose by sheer numbers. Guerrilla warfare in the Western Ghats terrain — where Mughal cavalry was ineffective and supply lines were vulnerable — allowed the smaller Maratha forces to be devastatingly effective.",
