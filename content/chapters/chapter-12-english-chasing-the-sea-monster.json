        "modelAnswer": "The crew of the Abraham Lincoln, led by Captain Farragut, finally sighted the mysterious sea monster after a long and tiring search. As the ship approached, the creature emitted a powerful and eerie electric glow that illuminated the dark waters of the Pacific Ocean. The crew was both terrified and excited, as they had never witnessed such a magnificent and strange sight before. Everyone on board prepared for a dangerous battle with what they believed was a giant narwhal or a formidable unknown sea beast.",

        "question": "How did the creature respond when it was chased by the Abraham Lincoln, and what shocked the crew?",
        "modelAnswer": "When the Abraham Lincoln tried to close the distance, the creature showed incredible speed and agility that no known sea animal possessed. It stayed at a constant distance from the ship, effortlessly matching its pace regardless of how much steam the engines produced. Even when Captain Farragut ordered the cannons to fire, the shells simply bounced off the creature's back as if it were made of solid steel. This defensive ability left the sailors bewildered and convinced that they were dealing with something extraordinary.",

        "modelAnswer": "Near midnight, the ship approached the creature while it appeared to be resting or asleep on the surface of the water. Ned Land, the world-renowned harpooner, took his position at the bow and launched his harpoon with great precision. The moment the harpoon struck, two massive jets of water erupted from the creature, crashing onto the ship's deck like a waterfall. In the resulting chaos and the violent lurch of the vessel, Professor Aronnax was thrown overboard into the dark, churning sea.",

        "question": "What were the major clues that suggested the 'sea monster' was actually a man-made machine?",
        "modelAnswer": "Several clues throughout the story indicated that the 'sea monster' was actually a man-made machine rather than a living being. First, the creature emitted a brilliant electric light, which was far too powerful and consistent to be natural bioluminescence. Second, its outer shell was so hard that cannonballs bounced off it with a metallic ring, suggesting an iron or steel construction. Finally, its ability to move at impossible speeds and expel powerful jets of water pointed towards mechanical propulsion and venting systems.",

          "The electric light was too powerful to be a natural animal glow.",

        "modelAnswer": "Jules Verne was a legendary 19th-century French author who is celebrated as the 'Father of Science Fiction' for his visionary ideas. He possessed a remarkable imagination and wrote about advanced technologies like submarines, space travel, and helicopters long before they were ever built. His most famous novel, 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea', introduced the world to the concept of deep-sea exploration in a mechanical vessel. Through his stories, Verne inspired generations of scientists and engineers to turn his fictional dreams into reality.",

        "question": "Explain the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs using examples from the story.",
        "modelAnswer": "A transitive verb is a verb that requires an object to complete its meaning, such as when Ned Land 'threw' his harpoon. In this case, 'threw' is transitive because the action is directed toward the object, the 'harpoon'. An intransitive verb, on the other hand, does not require an object to make sense, such as when the narrator 'fell' into the sea. The action of 'falling' is complete on its own and does not act upon another person or thing.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Transitive verbs require an object to complete their meaning.",
          "Example: 'Ned Land threw his harpoon' (object is harpoon).",
