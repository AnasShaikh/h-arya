        "question": "In the potato slicing experiment, what does each horizontal slice of the potato represent?",

        "question": "Closely spaced contour lines on a map indicate _____.",
        "answer": "Closely spaced contours mean that altitude changes rapidly over a short horizontal distance — which means a steep slope. Widely spaced contours mean gentle slope (altitude changes slowly over a long distance).",

        "question": "On a contour map, a valley (river valley) is shown by _____.",
        "answer": "A river valley is shown by V-shaped contour lines. The V always points upstream (toward the higher ground). This is because the river cuts into the hill creating a V-shaped valley, and contour lines must 'go into' the valley to represent the higher ground on either side.",

      {
        "question": "Why do contour lines never cross each other?",
        "answer": "Each point on Earth's surface has only one altitude. If two contours crossed, it would mean that one point has two different heights at the same time — which is impossible. Hence contours never cross.",

        "question": "A cliff is shown on a contour map by _____.",
        "answer": "A cliff is a near-vertical rock face. On a contour map, this means altitude changes dramatically over almost zero horizontal distance — so contour lines are extremely close together or actually touching.",

        "question": "How are contour maps useful for mountaineers?",
        "answer": "Mountaineers use contour maps to plan their ascent: avoid steep cliffs (touching contours), find gentle slopes (widely spaced contours) for easier climbing, locate flat areas (few/no contours) for camping, and find the safest route to the summit.",

It appears as concentric contour rings (circles within circles) indicating a hill that rises prominently from the surrounding plateau — exactly the kind of defensible terrain Shivaji's forces used for forts.",
