In olden times in India, acacia bark, neem twigs, coal powder, ash, tooth powder, salt, pomegranate rind were used for cleaning teeth. Today, however, a variety of toothpastes and tooth powders are used for this purpose. The principal ingredients of a toothpaste, calcium carbonate and calcium hydrogen phosphate, remove the dirt on the teeth. These ingredients also polish the teeth. A certain proportion of fluoride in the toothpaste helps prevent tooth decay. Fluoride is essential for the strengthening of bones and the enamel covering of teeth.",

      "content": "The word 'detergent' is derived from the Latin word 'detergere' which means 'to wipe away'. A detergent is 'a substance that cleans or wipes away dirt.' The molecules of a detergent are long and the properties of its two ends are different. A molecule of a detergent holds on to a water molecule at one end and an oil molecule at the other. As a result, the molecules of oil mix with the water. This is how soap acts when we wash ourselves or our soiled clothes. The oily layer sticks fast to the criss-crossing threads of the material of our clothes. Soap is used for removing it. Due to the property of holding on to both oil and water, soap water spreads easily on many types of surfaces. The property of a substance of spreading on a surface is called surface activity and the substance is said to be a surfactant.",

There are several types of producing these detergents. Synthetic detergents are obtained by subjecting raw materials to a variety of chemical processes. Synthetic detergents are used in many types of cosmetics. Soap is a salt of fatty acids. Hard soap is used for washing clothes. It is a sodium salt of fatty acids. Soft soap is used for bathing.

Cement is a dry, greenish grey powder with fine particles. It is made from silica (sand), alumina (aluminium oxide), lime, iron oxide and magnesia (magnesium oxide). Portland cement is the most commonly used cement for construction work. It is made from raw material which consists of 60% lime (calcium oxide), 25% silica (silicon dioxide), 5% alumina. The rest is iron oxide and gypsum (calcium sulphate). Portland cement gets its name from the stone quarried from the Isle of Portland in England, which has a similar texture. In ancient times, the Romans had made cement as well as concrete. They used to make aqueous cement by mixing volcanic ash in moistened lime. It was a very durable cement. With the decline of the Roman empire, this art of making cement was also forgotten. In 1756, the British engineer, John Smeaton developed the method of making aqueous cement.",
