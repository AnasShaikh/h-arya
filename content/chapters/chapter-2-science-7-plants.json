        "modelAnswer": "A typical flower consists of four main parts: Calyx, Corolla, Androecium, and Gynoecium. The Calyx is the outermost green part (sepals) that protects the flower in the bud stage. The Corolla is the colorful part made of petals that attracts insects. The Androecium is the male reproductive part consisting of stamens (anther and filament). The Gynoecium is the female reproductive part consisting of carpels (stigma, style, and ovary). These parts are arranged on the thalamus, which is the expanded end of the flower stalk or pedicel.",

        "question": "What is the difference between Tap Roots and Fibrous Roots?",
        "modelAnswer": "Dicotyledonous plants usually have a tap root system, which consists of a primary root that grows deep into the soil and produces secondary roots. In contrast, monocotyledonous plants have a fibrous root system, where a cluster of thin, thread-like roots grows from the base of the stem. Tap roots provide stronger anchorage and go deeper, while fibrous roots are more spread out near the surface.",

        "question": "Explain the process of germination of a seed.",
        "modelAnswer": "Germination is the process by which a seed develops into a new plant. When a seed receives proper water, air, and warmth, the embryo inside begins to grow. The part that grows towards the soil is called the radicle (which becomes the root), and the part that grows upwards out of the soil is called the plumule (which becomes the shoot). As the plant grows, it uses the food stored in the seed until it can perform photosynthesis.",
