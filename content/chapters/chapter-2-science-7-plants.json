        "modelAnswer": "Dicotyledonous plants, like hibiscus or mango, typically have a tap root system. This consists of a thick primary root that grows deep into the soil and produces smaller secondary roots. On the other hand, monocotyledonous plants, like jowar or onion, have a fibrous root system. This is a cluster of many thin, thread-like roots growing from the base of the stem. While tap roots provide deep anchorage, fibrous roots spread out near the surface and are excellent at preventing soil erosion.",

        "question": "Explain the structure and function of a typical flower.",
        "modelAnswer": "A typical flower has four main whorls: Calyx, Corolla, Androecium, and Gynoecium. The Calyx is the outermost green part (sepals) that protects the flower in the bud. The Corolla consists of colorful petals to attract insects for pollination. The Androecium is the male reproductive part made of stamens (anther and filament). The Gynoecium is the female reproductive part consisting of carpels (stigma, style, and ovary). After pollination and fertilization, the ovary develops into a fruit and the ovules become seeds.",

        "question": "What are the different parts of a leaf and their functions?",
        "modelAnswer": "A leaf consists of the leaf blade (lamina), leaf margin, leaf apex, and a petiole (stalk). The leaf blade is the flat, green part where photosynthesis occurs. The midrib and veins provide structural support and transport water and food. The petiole attaches the leaf to the stem at a node. Small openings called stomata on the leaf surface allow for gas exchange and transpiration. The arrangement of veins is called venation, which can be reticulate (net-like) or parallel.",

        "question": "Differentiate between Monocotyledonous and Dicotyledonous seeds.",
        "modelAnswer": "Seeds are classified based on the number of cotyledons (seed leaves) they contain. Dicotyledonous seeds, like moong or gram, can be divided into two equal parts (cotyledons). Monocotyledonous seeds, like jowar or corn, do not divide into two equal parts and have only one cotyledon. This difference is also reflected in other plant parts: dicots usually have tap roots and reticulate venation, while monocots have fibrous roots and parallel venation.",
