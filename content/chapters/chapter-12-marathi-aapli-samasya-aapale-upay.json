    "description": "An activity-based chapter focused on practical problem-solving. It features a conversation between Jordan and his/her mother about upcycling old clothes into useful items — purses, torans (decorative hangings), doormats. The core lesson is Reduce-Reuse-Recycle (3R). It also addresses computer safety rules in the Marathi context. Grammar focus: Marathi Spelling Rules (शुद्धलेखनाचे नियम) — specifically the rule that in Marathi words, the vowel before the final consonant (in अकारान्त words) takes a long form for इकार and उकार. Also introduces Marathi proverbs (म्हणी) with their meanings."

(1) Reduce means buying and consuming less — only get what you truly need; (2) Reuse means finding new uses for old items instead of throwing them away; (3) Recycle means processing old materials (paper, glass, plastic, metal) into new products. In the chapter, Jordan's conversation with his mother shows how old, worn clothes — instead of being thrown away — can be repurposed into useful items. This saves money, reduces waste, and is good for the environment. The Marathi concept is: 'जे आहे ते वापरा' (use what you have).",
