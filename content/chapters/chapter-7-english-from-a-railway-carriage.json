        "question": "Explain the meaning of the phrase 'Each a glimpse and gone for ever' in the context of the poem.",
        "modelAnswer": "The phrase 'Each a glimpse and gone for ever' emphasizes the extreme speed at which the train is traveling. As the poet looks out the window, various sights like people, animals, and landscapes appear only for a split second before vanishing. Because the train is moving so rapidly, the poet cannot focus on any single object for long. This beautifully conveys the fleeting nature of the journey and the rapid, unstoppable passage of time.",

        "modelAnswer": "The rhythm of the poem is carefully constructed to mimic the fast, steady movement of a speeding train.

The child seems to be struggling all alone to gather wild blackberry bushes or brambles as the train speeds by.
