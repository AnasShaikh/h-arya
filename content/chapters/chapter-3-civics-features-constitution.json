        "question": "Answer: Why does the Government function at two levels in a federation?",
        "modelAnswer": "In a federation, powers are constitutionally divided so governance can be effective across a large and diverse country. The Union Government handles national-level matters like defence, foreign affairs, and currency, while State Governments handle region-specific subjects like local administration, public order, and certain social sectors. This two-level structure balances national unity with regional needs and democratic participation.",

          "Federal systems divide powers between Union and States.",
          "National subjects are handled centrally; local/regional subjects by states.",
          "Structure ensures administrative efficiency in a large diverse country.",
          "It balances unity with autonomy and local responsiveness."

        "modelAnswer": "Residuary powers are law-making powers over subjects not explicitly listed in the Union, State, or Concurrent Lists of the Constitution. In India, such powers are vested in Parliament. This provision helps the system respond to new and emerging issues that were not foreseen when the lists were originally framed.",

          "In India, Parliament exercises these powers.",
          "They help address new areas like emerging technologies or novel policy issues.",
          "Provision ensures constitutional flexibility over time."

        "modelAnswer": "An independent judiciary is essential to uphold rule of law, protect fundamental rights, and ensure that laws and government actions remain constitutional. If courts are independent from executive and legislative pressure, they can decide disputes fairly and impartially. This builds public trust and acts as a safeguard against misuse of power in a democracy.",

          "Judiciary can review laws and government actions impartially.",

        "modelAnswer": "The major merits of an independent judiciary are impartial justice, constitutional protection, and checks on executive/legislative excesses. It strengthens democracy and public confidence in institutions. Possible demerits include delays, procedural complexity, and, at times, friction with elected branches if coordination is weak. However, these issues should be addressed through reforms, not by weakening judicial independence.",
