        "answer": "Let the original length of the rectangle be 'l' and the original breadth be 'b'. The perimeter of this original rectangle is given by the formula 2(l + b). If both the length and breadth are doubled, the new length becomes 2l and the new breadth becomes 2b. The perimeter of the new rectangle is then calculated as 2(2l + 2b), which simplifies to 4(l + b). By comparing the two perimeters, we can see that 4(l + b) is exactly twice the value of 2(l + b), meaning the new perimeter will be two times the original perimeter.",

        "answer": "Let the side length of the original square be denoted as 'a'. The perimeter of this original square is calculated as 4a. When the side of the square is tripled, the new side length becomes 3a. To find the perimeter of this new square, we multiply the new side length by 4, giving 4 × (3a) = 12a. Since 12a is three times the original perimeter of 4a, the perimeter of the new square will be exactly three times that of the first square.",

        "question": "Given alongside is the diagram of a playground. It shows the length of its sides. Find the perimeter of the playground.",
        "answer": "To find the perimeter of the playground, we must calculate the total length of its outer boundary. In a rectilinear shape where opposite sides are parallel, the sum of the broken segments on one side equals the length of the continuous opposite side. If the top continuous side is 15m, the opposite bottom horizontal segments also sum up to 15m. Similarly, if the left continuous side is 15m, the right vertical segments sum up to 15m. Therefore, the total perimeter is equivalent to a bounding rectangle of 15m by 15m, which is calculated as 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 60 meters.",

        "question": "As shown in the figure, four napkins all of the same size were made from a square piece of cloth of length 1 m. What length of lace will be required to trim all four sides of all the napkins?",
        "answer": "A square piece of cloth with a side length of 1 meter is cut into four identical smaller square napkins. This is done by cutting the square perfectly in half both horizontally and vertically, resulting in four smaller squares each having a side length of 0.5 meters. To find the lace required for one napkin, we calculate its perimeter: 4 × 0.5m = 2 meters. Since there are four identical napkins that need to be trimmed with lace on all sides, the total length of lace required is 4 napkins × 2 meters/napkin = 8 meters.",
