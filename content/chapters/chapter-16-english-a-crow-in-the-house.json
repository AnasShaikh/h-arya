The story begins when a young crow falls from its nest. The narrator and his Grandfather find it and decide to rescue it. They feed it bread and milk and even some of Grandmother's plum wine to revive it. The crow survives and is named Caesar — a powerful and amusing name for a cheeky crow! The Grandfather has a soft heart for animals, and together they nurse Caesar back to health. Caesar quickly becomes a member of the household. The rescue shows the kindness and love of the family for animals — a theme common in Ruskin Bond's stories.",

The house had several pets, and he tolerated their different habits rather than driving them away. When Caesar the crow entered their lives, Grandfather allowed him to stay and accepted his mischievous behaviour with patience. This welcoming attitude shows affection toward living creatures rather than strict control.",

The cat might protest that Caesar never let it rest peacefully, while the dog might complain that Caesar stole attention and teased everyone. Smaller pets could object to his sudden entries, fluttering wings, and habit of taking things away.

At home, he disturbed people and pets, carried away small objects, and behaved as if he owned the place. Outside, he troubled neighbours by taking things such as brushes and creating public nuisance.

        "modelAnswer": "The sentence means Aunt Mabel could not build comfort or trust with the animals in the house. She may have been strict, impatient, or uneasy around their unpredictable behaviour, and animals often sense such discomfort quickly. Unlike others who accepted the pets naturally, she struggled to connect with them. Therefore, the pets did not respond warmly to her presence.",
