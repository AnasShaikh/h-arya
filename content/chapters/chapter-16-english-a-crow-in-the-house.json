      "content": "The story 'A Crow in the House' is written by Ruskin Bond, one of India's most beloved English authors, famous for his stories set in the Himalayan region. The story begins when a young crow falls from its nest. The narrator and his Grandfather find it and decide to rescue it. They feed it bread and milk and even some of Grandmother's plum wine to revive it. The crow survives and is named Caesar — a powerful and amusing name for a cheeky crow! The Grandfather has a soft heart for animals, and together they nurse Caesar back to health. Caesar quickly becomes a member of the household. The rescue shows the kindness and love of the family for animals — a theme common in Ruskin Bond's stories.",
