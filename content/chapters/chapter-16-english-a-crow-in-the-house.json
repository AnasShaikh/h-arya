The story begins when a young crow falls from its nest. The narrator and his Grandfather find it and decide to rescue it. They feed it bread and milk and even some of Grandmother's plum wine to revive it. The crow survives and is named Caesar — a powerful and amusing name for a cheeky crow! The Grandfather has a soft heart for animals, and together they nurse Caesar back to health. Caesar quickly becomes a member of the household. The rescue shows the kindness and love of the family for animals — a theme common in Ruskin Bond's stories.",

        "modelAnswer": "Yes, the author's Grandfather definitely liked animals, as he kept several pets at home. We know this because when the narrator brought the injured young crow home, Grandfather actively helped him do his best to revive it. He patiently assisted in feeding the bird by gently opening its beak and giving it bread and milk. Additionally, the story mentions that Grandfather already had other pets in the house, such as dogs and a hornbill named Harold, which proves his immense fondness for animals.",

The dogs might have barked and growled at him in frustration because he constantly tugged at their tails. Harold the Hornbill would have felt threatened and angry when Caesar perched on top of his cage and pecked at his feet. The pets might have felt that their peaceful lives were ruined by this new, mischievous bird who received a lot of attention despite his bad behaviour.",

He also enjoyed overturning flower vases and mischievously tugging at the tails of the household dogs. Outside the house, his pranks extended to visiting neighbouring houses and stealing various small items like pens, pencils, and hair-ribbons.

        "modelAnswer": "The phrase means that Aunt Mabel could not get along well with the animals in the house, and they often caused her trouble. This is evident when Caesar knocked off her gleaming spectacles with his beak when she leaned forward for a kiss. The pets probably sensed that she was not very comfortable or genuinely fond of them. Her nervous or unnatural behaviour around animals might have made them act mischievously towards her.",

Even when Caesar became a nuisance by destroying things and stealing from neighbours, the author tolerated his behaviour and did not lock him in a cage. When Caesar's leg was broken by a neighbour, the author gently carried him home, washed his leg, and bandaged it carefully.
