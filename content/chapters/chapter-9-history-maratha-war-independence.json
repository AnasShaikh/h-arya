Aurangzeb reportedly asked Sambhaji to reveal the hiding places of Maratha treasure and the names of all his officers, and to convert to Islam — in return for his life. Sambhaji refused all demands. He was subjected to terrible torture for several days but did not reveal any information or abandon his faith. On 11 March 1689, Sambhaji Maharaj was executed.

From Jinji — thousands of kilometers from Maharashtra — Rajaram continued to direct the Maratha resistance for years. Meanwhile, in Maharashtra, Maratha commanders like Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav fought a brilliant guerrilla campaign against Aurangzeb's army, keeping the Mughals constantly off-balance.

She personally organized and directed Maratha military campaigns, appointed commanders, managed diplomacy, and kept the Swaraj alive through sheer determination and political intelligence.

His goal was simple: destroy the Maratha Swaraj and absorb the Deccan into the Mughal empire. Instead, he spent the last 27 years of his 90-year life in the Deccan, fighting, and ultimately failing. The campaign ruined the Mughal empire financially — maintaining such a massive army for decades depleted the imperial treasury. Aurangzeb absorbed the remaining Deccan Sultanates (Adilshahi in 1686, Qutbshahi in 1687) — but these victories only brought more problems, as Maratha guerrilla warfare spread across a wider area. When Aurangzeb died in Ahmednagar in 1707 (ironically, in Maharashtra — the land he had tried to conquer), he reportedly wrote a sorrowful letter confessing that he had failed and did not know what would happen to his empire.

The Maratha civil dispute was eventually resolved and Shahu became the accepted Chhatrapati. Under Shahu Maharaj, the Maratha empire entered a new expansionary phase.
