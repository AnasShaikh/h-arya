        "modelAnswer": "In Carroll’s parody, the crocodile is described as pouring the waters of the Nile on every golden scale. This exaggerated image creates a polished and attractive appearance. It helps build irony because the crocodile looks pleasant but is actually dangerous. Thus the line supports the poem’s comic contrast.",
        "keyPoints": [

          "The image is exaggerated and humorous.",

        "question": "What is the humour in Carroll's crocodile poem?",
        "modelAnswer": "The humour in Carroll’s crocodile poem comes from parody and irony. Carroll imitates the serious moral tone of didactic poems but replaces the virtuous bee with a smiling predator. The crocodile appears polite and welcoming while actually preparing to eat fish. This unexpected reversal makes the poem funny.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Humour is created through parody.",
          "A moral model is replaced by a predator.",
          "The crocodile’s polite image is ironic.",

        "question": "What is a parody?",
        "modelAnswer": "A parody is a humorous imitation of another writer, poem, or style. It keeps some features of the original, such as rhythm or structure, but changes ideas to produce comic effect. The purpose is often to entertain, and sometimes to critique the original tone. Carroll’s poem is a parody of a moral poem by Isaac Watts.",

          "It retains form but changes content.",
          "It creates comic effect and sometimes critique.",
          "Carroll parodies Watts’ moral style."

It represents the ideal habit of using time wisely rather than wasting it. Therefore, the bee stands for disciplined and honest effort.",

        "question": "What does the crocodile symbolise in Carroll's parody?",
        "modelAnswer": "In Carroll’s parody, the crocodile symbolizes deceptive danger. It appears cheerful, clean, and inviting, yet it is a predator waiting to trap fish. This contrast mocks blind trust in outward appearance. The crocodile therefore represents cunning hidden behind politeness.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Crocodile symbolizes hidden danger.",
          "Outer gentleness contrasts with inner threat.",
          "The image warns against judging by appearance.",
          "It represents cunning and deception."
