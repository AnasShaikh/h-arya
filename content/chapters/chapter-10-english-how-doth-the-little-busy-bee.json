        "modelAnswer": "Watts presents the bee as a model of industry, discipline and usefulness. The poem encourages children to stay active in meaningful work and avoid idleness. Through simple imagery of a bee gathering honey, the poet suggests that steady effort leads to productive and moral living.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Bee symbolizes hard work and purposeful activity.",
          "Poem promotes disciplined use of time.",

        "modelAnswer": "Carroll creates humour by imitating the structure of a well-known moral poem but replacing its virtuous bee with a smiling crocodile. The language sounds sweet and polite, yet the crocodile is actually dangerous and deceptive. This contrast between tone and reality produces comic irony and playful satire.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Parody copies familiar form but changes meaning.",
          "Crocodile replaces bee to reverse moral tone.",
          "Humour comes from contrast: pleasant words vs hidden danger.",
          "Creates irony and light satire."

        "question": "What is a parody? Explain with reference to this lesson.",
        "modelAnswer": "A parody is a humorous imitation of an existing poem, song, style, or text. It keeps recognizable features of the original but changes content, tone, or intent to create laughter or critique. In this lesson, Carroll’s crocodile poem parodies Watts’ busy bee poem by transforming a moral teaching model into a playful, ironic version.",

          "Parody = imitation with humorous transformation.",
          "Maintains original structure/style for recognizability.",

        "question": "Compare the symbols of the bee and the crocodile in the two poems.",
        "modelAnswer": "In Watts’ poem, the bee symbolizes sincere work, discipline, and social usefulness. In Carroll’s parody, the crocodile symbolizes deceptive charm and concealed danger. Thus one figure supports moral instruction, while the other playfully questions blind acceptance of didactic tone. The contrast highlights how imagery can reshape meaning completely.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Bee = industry and moral usefulness.",
          "Crocodile = deceptive appearance and danger.",
          "Symbol change creates shift from moral lesson to irony.",

        "question": "Write in brief: Why is understanding tone important when reading poetry?",
        "modelAnswer": "Tone helps readers understand whether a poem is serious, moral, playful, ironic, or critical. Without tone awareness, a parody may be misread as a straightforward moral poem. In this lesson, tone distinguishes sincere advice in Watts from comic irony in Carroll. Therefore, tone is essential for accurate interpretation.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Tone conveys poet’s attitude and intent.",
          "Essential to distinguish sincere vs ironic writing.",
          "Prevents misunderstanding in parody/satire poems."

        "question": "Creative response: Write a short idea for your own parody of a familiar moral rhyme.",
        "modelAnswer": "I would choose a well-known moral rhyme and keep its rhythm and rhyme pattern. Then I would replace the ideal character with an unexpected one, such as a very polite but mischievous cat, to create comic contrast. The parody would sound serious on the surface but gently expose hypocrisy or exaggeration. This would help readers enjoy language while thinking critically.",
        "keyPoints": [
          "Retain recognizable rhythm/structure of original.",
          "Introduce surprising character or reversal.",
          "Use contrast to create humour and reflection.",
          "Parody should entertain and provoke thought."
