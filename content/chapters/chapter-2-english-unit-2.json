        "modelAnswer": "The rhythm of R.L. Stevenson's poem 'From a Railway Carriage' is fast and regular, designed to imitate the steady, 'galloping' pace of a steam train. Each line contains four strong beats that mirror the repetitive sound of wheels clicking against the tracks. The poet uses rapid descriptions of sights like bridges, houses, and ditches to create a sense of blurring speed. This unique rhythmic structure allows the reader to experience the physical sensation of a fast-moving journey through the countryside.",

        "modelAnswer": "In the story 'The Souvenir', Sayali's earrings became extremely heavy because of the difference between the Moon's gravity and Earth's gravity. The Moon's gravitational pull is only one-sixth of that on Earth, which means objects feel much lighter there. When Sayali bought the earrings in the Moon settlement, they seemed light and easy to wear. However, upon returning to Earth, the planet's much stronger gravity pulled on them with full force, making them painful to wear.",

        "modelAnswer": "Abdul demonstrated great resourcefulness by managing the royal poultry without spending any money from the treasury. Instead of requesting expensive grain, he followed the principle of 'waste not, want not' and collected scraps from the royal kitchen. He fed the hens with vegetable skins, fruit shells, and leftover food that was usually thrown away. This creative approach kept the hens healthy and productive while saving the Emperor a significant amount of gold.",

He also discovered the principle of the electrical generator by showing that moving a magnet near a wire could create an electric current. These breakthroughs provided the foundation for almost all modern electrical technology, including fans, cars, and power plants. His work transformed electricity from a laboratory curiosity into a powerful tool that changed human life forever.",

Instead of asking for money to buy expensive materials, he noticed that formal requests to the Emperor arrived in beautiful silk bags that were later discarded. He collected these silk bags and had the royal tailors sew them into elegant jackets for the books. This made the library look magnificent and colorful at zero cost, showcasing Abdul's brilliant ability to recycle luxury materials.",

        "modelAnswer": "Biomimicry is the science of solving human problems by imitating the designs and behaviors found in nature. In yoga, many asanas are based on this concept, as ancient yogis observed animals and noticed their unique physical strengths. For example, 'Bhujangasana' mimics the raised head of a cobra to strengthen the spine, while 'Simhasana' mimics a lion's roar to exercise facial muscles. By imitating these natural postures, humans can achieve physical balance, mental focus, and improved health.",

In contrast, Lewis Carroll wrote a parody called 'How doth the little crocodile' which mimics the structure of the original poem but changes the meaning. While the bee is praised for gathering honey, the crocodile is shown 'grinning' and 'welcoming little fishes' into its jaws. Carroll uses humor and a dark twist to poke fun at the overly serious moral lessons found in traditional children's poetry.",

        "modelAnswer": "Michael Faraday was born into a very poor family and had to leave school at the age of twelve to work. He faced further challenges due to a speech defect that made it difficult for him to communicate clearly as a child. Despite these hurdles, he educated himself by reading the books he was assigned to bind as a bookbinder's apprentice. His intense curiosity and habit of taking detailed notes on scientific lectures eventually caught the attention of Sir Humphry Davy, leading to his career as a scientist.",
