Timur (Tamerlane), a Central Asian conqueror, invaded Delhi, looted the city, massacred thousands of people, and left the Sultanate in ruins. After Timur's invasion, the central authority of Delhi collapsed. Local governors and regional chiefs asserted their independence, leading to the creation of many smaller regional kingdoms across India. This fragmentation of power — while politically unstable — actually created space for diverse regional cultures and languages to flourish. By the early 16th century, the last effective rulers of the Sultanate were overthrown by the arrival of the Mughals.",

Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort and Jama Masjid in Delhi. However, his construction projects were enormously expensive. His son Aurangzeb (ruled 1658-1707) had a very different approach — he imprisoned his own father to seize power, reversed many of Akbar's tolerant policies, reimposed the jizya tax, and destroyed several Hindu temples.
