      "content": "We have already learnt about galaxies and stars as well as the solar system and its different components. Stars are born out of nebulae. Nebulae are clouds made up mainly of hydrogen gas and dust particles. The particles in these clouds are attracted towards one another due to the force of gravity. As a result, the cloud contracts and becomes dense and spherical in shape. At the same time, the pressure of the gas at the core of the cloud increases causing the temperature to rise tremendously and energy generation processes start there. Such a spherical cloud of hydrogen is called a 'star'. The different forms of the stars at various stages during this lifecycle are identified as different types of stars. Our solar system is a tiny part of a galaxy called the Milky Way, which is many, many times larger than the solar system.",

While standing on the ground, the point on the celestial sphere exactly above our head is called the zenith. While standing on the ground, the point on the celestial sphere exactly below our feet is called the nadir. If we extend the axis of rotation of the earth in the north and south directions it will penetrate the celestial sphere at points called the celestial North Pole and the celestial South Pole, respectively.

This is what we express when we say that the sun enters a particular zodiac sign or raashi. For example, on Makar Sankranti we say that the sun enters Makar raashi (Capricorn zodiac sign). When the earth is at A, for an observer on the earth, the sun appears to be in the Scorpio zodiac sign. When the earth moves from A to B, the observer will say that the sun has entered Libra.
