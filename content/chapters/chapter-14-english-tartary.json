In it, the poet imagines being the all-powerful lord of a magical kingdom called Tartary. Tartary was a historical name used in Europe for a vast region of central Asia, which felt mysterious and exotic. De la Mare uses it as the name of his dream kingdom. The poem has four stanzas and is written in first person — the poet speaks directly saying 'If I were lord of Tartary...' He describes all the wonderful, luxurious, and magical things he would have if he ruled this kingdom.",

Every day, trumpeters would blow their trumpets to announce him. Musicians would play three instruments — harp, flute, and mandoline — creating sweet music around him. He would wear a robe (a long gown) made of shining beads. Peacocks (known for their gorgeous tails) would flaunt (show off) their feathers in his gardens.

A scented breeze (a wind carrying sweet fragrance) would blow gently. There would be a trembling lake — a lake that shimmers and ripples beautifully.

It is a literary and sound device that makes language musical and pleasing to the ear. It is different from rhyme — in rhyme, the vowel sounds match too, but in consonance, only the consonant sounds repeat. For example, in 'pitter-patter', both words end with the 't-r' sound. In 'Rivers silver-pale', the 'r' sound repeats. Consonance is used in poetry, songs, and everyday expressions. It gives writing a musical quality. Another example: 'All's well that ends well' — the 'l' sound repeats at the end of 'well' and 'well'.",

        "modelAnswer": "My imagined region lies between green hills and a wide silver river. Waterfalls descend into clear lakes where lotuses bloom and birds gather at dawn. The forests are rich with flowering trees, deer, peacocks, and gentle winds carrying fragrance. Villages are clean and artistic, with people who celebrate music and nature. At night, the sky is deep and star-filled, reflecting in the still water like scattered diamonds. The region feels peaceful, fertile, and full of life.",

        "modelAnswer": "The poem creates beauty by combining vivid colour words, musical sound patterns, and rich natural imagery. Colours like “yellow as honey,” “red as wine,” and “purple vale” make the kingdom visually radiant. Sounds from “trumpeters,” “harp, flute, and mandoline” create a festive atmosphere. Nature images such as rivers, hills, glades, fishes, stars, and scented breeze turn Tartary into a dream world. These elements together make the poem sensuous and memorable.",

These comparisons strengthen the dreamlike beauty of Tartary.",

Royal objects like ivory bed and golden throne represent luxury, while forests, rivers, birds, and stars bring natural abundance. Music, colour, and ceremony make life graceful and joyful.

        "question": "Write a short critical note on the title “Tartary”.",
        "modelAnswer": "The title “Tartary” is effective because it immediately suggests a distant, exotic, and imaginative land. It sets the tone for fantasy and prepares the reader for unusual splendour and dream imagery. The place functions less as a map location and more as a symbol of the speaker’s ideal world. Thus, the title supports the poem’s central mood of romantic imagination.",
