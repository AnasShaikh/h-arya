      "content": "Walter de la Mare (1873–1956) was an English poet who loved writing about fantasy, dreams, and imaginary worlds. 'Tartary' is one of his most famous poems. In it, the poet imagines being the all-powerful lord of a magical kingdom called Tartary. Tartary was a historical name used in Europe for a vast region of central Asia, which felt mysterious and exotic. De la Mare uses it as the name of his dream kingdom. The poem has four stanzas and is written in first person — the poet speaks directly saying 'If I were lord of Tartary...' He describes all the wonderful, luxurious, and magical things he would have if he ruled this kingdom.",

Every day, trumpeters would blow their trumpets to announce him. Musicians would play three instruments — harp, flute, and mandoline — creating sweet music around him. He would wear a robe (a long gown) made of shining beads. Peacocks (known for their gorgeous tails) would flaunt (show off) their feathers in his gardens. Tigers would haunt (roam freely) in his dark forests. All these images create a picture of a wild, luxurious, magical kingdom.",

The rivers in Tartary would be silver-pale, glittering like silver in the moonlight. The night sky would be full of flashing stars. A scented breeze (a wind carrying sweet fragrance) would blow gently. There would be a trembling lake — a lake that shimmers and ripples beautifully.

      "content": "Consonance is the repetition of the same consonant sounds in nearby words, especially at the end of words. It is a literary and sound device that makes language musical and pleasing to the ear. It is different from rhyme — in rhyme, the vowel sounds match too, but in consonance, only the consonant sounds repeat. For example, in 'pitter-patter', both words end with the 't-r' sound. In 'Rivers silver-pale', the 'r' sound repeats. Consonance is used in poetry, songs, and everyday expressions. It gives writing a musical quality. Another example: 'All's well that ends well' — the 'l' sound repeats at the end of 'well' and 'well'.",
