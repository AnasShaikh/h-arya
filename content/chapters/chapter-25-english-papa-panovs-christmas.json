'Papa Panov's Special Christmas' is a warm, deeply spiritual short story. Papa Panov is an old shoemaker living alone in Russia. On Christmas Eve, he reads the Christmas story (the birth of Jesus) in his Bible. He is moved to tears and wishes he could have been there to offer Jesus a gift. He falls asleep and dreams that Jesus speaks to him: 'I will come and visit you tomorrow.' Papa Panov is overjoyed. On Christmas morning, he wakes up early and excitedly prepares for Jesus' visit. He sets out food and gets his shop ready, his heart full of hope and anticipation.",

He calls the sweeper in and gives him hot coffee to warm himself. This act of spontaneous kindness is the first of three acts of compassion Papa Panov will perform that day.

He remembers that he had made a pair of beautiful, small leather shoes, specifically kept to give as a gift to Jesus when he visited. These were his best, most precious shoes.
