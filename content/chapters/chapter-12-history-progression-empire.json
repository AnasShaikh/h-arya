By the late 18th century, the Maratha confederacy controlled a vast arc of territory spanning from Pune in the west to Orissa in the east, Punjab in the north, and deep into South India. The Maratha Peshwas were effectively the power behind the Mughal emperor — they reinstated, protected, and directed the nominal Mughal sovereignty. Mahadaji Shinde became the regent of the Mughal emperor and controlled Delhi. The Holkars controlled Malwa and Indore. The Bhosales of Nagpur dominated central India. The Gaekwads controlled Gujarat. At this peak, the Maratha empire was arguably the most powerful political force in the Indian subcontinent.

Over the next century and a half, the Company gradually transformed from a trading enterprise into a political and military power. They established trading posts (factories) at Surat, Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta. They built their own armies — composed primarily of Indian soldiers (sepoys) trained in European military methods. They exploited the political divisions among Indian kingdoms to expand their influence through a clever strategy called 'subsidiary alliances' — they offered military protection to Indian rulers who accepted British dominance and paid for British troops to be stationed in their territory. The weakened Mughal empire, the fragmented Maratha confederacy, and various smaller kingdoms all became targets of British expansion.

The British supported one claimant to the Peshwa position against the actual Peshwa — a classic divide-and-rule strategy.

The British suffered several humiliating defeats, most notably at the Battle of Wadgaon (1779) where a British force was completely surrounded and forced to surrender. The war ended with the Treaty of Salbai (1782) — generally favorable to the Marathas. The British agreed to give back territories they had captured and recognized Maratha sovereignty. This was the last time the British suffered a significant defeat at Maratha hands.

Maratha chiefs like Scindias and Bhosales fought the British independently but were defeated in a series of battles. The British gained control of Delhi, Agra, and significant territories. The Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1818) was the final conflict. Peshwa Bajirao II attempted to shake off British control, but the Maratha forces were poorly coordinated. The British under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington) and other commanders systematically defeated Maratha forces. The Battle of Koregaon (1 January 1818) and the fall of Pune marked the end. The Peshwai was abolished on 1 June 1818. Bajirao II was exiled to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension.",

In 1857, when the great Indian revolt broke out — the first war of independence — Nana Saheb led the revolt in the Kanpur region and Tatya Tope conducted brilliant guerrilla campaigns across central India. Though the 1857 revolt was ultimately suppressed, it was significantly fueled by the memory of Maratha Swaraj and the desire to free India from British rule.

        "question": "What was the 'subsidiary alliance' system used by the British?",
        "answer": "The subsidiary alliance system was a clever British strategy — they offered military protection to Indian rulers, but the ruler had to pay for British troops stationed in their territory, dismiss their own foreign ministers, and accept British advice on governance. It was effectively a way to take control while appearing to offer help.",

        "question": "Which Peshwa signed the Treaty of Bassein (1802), accepting British suzerainty?",
        "answer": "Peshwa Bajirao II — described as weak and treacherous — signed the Treaty of Bassein (1802) with the British, accepting their suzerainty in exchange for personal protection against his Maratha rivals. This effectively surrendered Maratha independence.",

        "answer": "Nana Saheb and Tatya Tope's revolt in 1857 was directly linked to the Maratha Swaraj — they sought to restore the Maratha sovereignty that had been ended in 1818. The memory of Shivaji's just rule and the humiliation of the 1818 defeat directly fueled their resistance.",

        "question": "Discuss: Reasons behind the end of Maratha rule.",
        "modelAnswer": "The end of Maratha rule was caused by a combination of internal weakness and external pressure. After capable leaders like Mahadji Shinde and Nana Phadnavis, unity among Maratha sardars declined and factional conflict increased. Leadership under Bajirao II remained weak, while the British used diplomacy, military strength and political intervention to exploit divisions. Repeated Anglo-Maratha conflicts ended with British victories, including the capture of Pune and final defeat in 1818.",

          "Internal rivalry and lack of unity weakened Maratha power.",
          "Loss of strong statesman-like leadership created instability.",
          "British strategy exploited divisions through war and diplomacy.",
