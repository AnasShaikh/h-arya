        "modelAnswer": "Malti and Rima are presented as contrasts. Malti appears simple and traditional, but she is intelligent, hardworking and talented in singing. She performs well in studies, especially mathematics, and is polite and helpful toward classmates. Her weak point is spoken English, which she honestly acknowledges and tries to improve. Rima, in contrast, appears stylish and confident and also sings well, but she judges others by appearance and accent. Her weak points are pride, prejudice and lack of empathy, though the story suggests she has the capacity to change.",

Some girls repeated my greeting in a strange tone, and slowly I realized they were making fun of my accent. I felt hurt and lonely, but I decided not to give up. I focused on studies and answered questions in class. The singing competition gave me confidence because people listened to me seriously.

        "modelAnswer": "A clear and understandable accent is useful, but having a “perfect” accent is not necessary for intelligence or worth. Communication should be judged by clarity, confidence and respect, not by imitation of a particular speech style. Students can improve pronunciation by listening carefully to model speech, reading aloud, using dictionary audio, practicing difficult sounds, recording their speech, and speaking regularly without fear. The goal is effective communication, not accent-based superiority.",

        "modelAnswer": "We should treat every classmate with dignity, patience and inclusion, regardless of language, accent, dress or background. A classroom becomes stronger when students help one another learn rather than humiliating others for differences. If someone struggles in one area, we should guide them respectfully while also learning from their strengths. Inclusive behaviour builds trust, confidence and genuine friendship.",

        "modelAnswer": "The story teaches that judging people by outward appearance or accent is unfair and harmful. Real ability may be hidden behind simplicity, and kindness is more valuable than social show. It also emphasizes self-reflection: those who mock others may later realize their own weaknesses. The central message is to replace snobbery with empathy and respect.",

She apologizes sincerely and offers to help Malti with spoken English. In return, Malti helps Rima and others in mathematics. Over time, the class becomes more cooperative and less judgmental. The friendship between the two girls becomes an example of how respect and learning can replace prejudice.",
