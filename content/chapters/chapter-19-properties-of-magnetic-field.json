The south pole of the magnetic sphere was attracted towards it. The north pole of a freely suspended magnet settles in the direction of the geographic north pole of the earth. It means that the south pole of some gigantic magnet must be near the geographic north pole of the earth and the north pole of that magnet, near the geographic south pole of the earth.",
