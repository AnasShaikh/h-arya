Convert to multiple choice:
```
Textbook: "Sound is generated by _____ of any object."
MCQ Format:
Question: "Sound is generated by the _____ of any object."
Options: [vibration, rotation, movement, heat]
Correct: vibration
```

**2. Match the Pairs**

- Gradually reduce support

### Assessment Strategy

**Pre-Assessment (Diagnostic):**
- Purpose: Gauge current knowledge
- 5 questions covering main concepts
- Mix of difficulty levels
- No penalty for wrong answers
- Informs personalization

**Test (Summative):**
- Purpose: Measure learning outcomes
- 10 questions from textbook Exercise
- Comprehensive coverage
- Determines mastery level
- Triggers revision if needed

## 📊 Assessment Philosophy

### Question Design Principles

**Good Questions:**
- Test understanding, not memory
- Have ONE clearly correct answer
- Options are plausible but distinctly wrong
- No negative marking in phrasing
- Relate to textbook content

**Question Difficulty:**
- **Easy:** Direct recall from textbook
- **Medium:** Application of concept
- **Hard:** Analysis or synthesis

**Example:**

**Easy:** "Sound is generated by _____."
**Medium:** "Why does sound travel faster in solids than in air?"
**Hard:** "If a pendulum's length is doubled, how does its frequency change?"

### Feedback Strategy

**For Correct Answers:**
- Praise: "Excellent!" "Well done!"
- Reinforce: Explain WHY it's correct
- Build confidence

**For Wrong Answers:**
- Gentle: "Not quite, but good thinking!"
- Explain: What's wrong and why
- Guide: Point towards correct reasoning
- Encourage: "Let's review this concept"

---

## 🎨 Visual Content Guidelines

### Emojis and Icons

**Purpose:** Make learning engaging
**Usage:** Support understanding, don't distract

**Appropriate Emojis:**
- Conceptual: 🔊 (sound), 💡 (light), 🔥 (heat)
- Instructional: ✅ (correct), ❌ (wrong), 💡 (tip)
- Emotional: 🌟 (excellent), 👍 (good), 💪 (keep trying)
- Objects: 🎸 (guitar), 📱 (phone), 🔔 (bell)

**Avoid:**
- Excessive emojis (max 3 per concept)
- Culturally specific emojis (🎄, 🍔)
- Confusing symbols
- Gender-specific when unnecessary

### Color Coding

**Educational Purpose:**
- Each concept has unique color
- Color indicates function (success=green, error=red)
- Maintains consistency across chapters

**Accessibility:**
- High contrast text on backgrounds
- Color + text labels (not color alone)
- Works for colorblind users

---

## 🗣️ Language & Tone

### Writing Style

**Characteristics:**
- Friendly, not formal
- Encouraging, not judgmental
- Clear, not verbose
- Active, not passive voice
- Direct address ("you", not "one" or "students")

**Examples:**

**Good:**
"You've learned that sound travels through air. Now let's see how it travels through water!"

**Not Ideal:**
"It has been learned that sound travels through air. The propagation through aqueous medium will now be examined."

### AI Tutor Personality

**The AI should:**
- Be patient and understanding
- Celebrate small victories
- Never make student feel bad about mistakes
- Use encouraging language
- Ask questions to check understanding
- Relate to student's experience

**Conversation Examples:**

"Great question! Let me explain frequency in a simple way..."

"I can see you're thinking hard about this. Let's break it down step by step..."

"Wow! You got that right! Do you know why your answer is correct?"

## ✏️ Exercise Question Guidelines

### Conversion Rules

**Textbook Exercise → AI Tutor Format**

**1. Fill in the Blanks:**
```
Textbook: "The unit of frequency is _____."

AI Tutor MCQ:
Question: "The unit of frequency is _____."
Options: ["Hertz", "Decibel", "Meter", "Second"]
Correct: "A" (Hertz)
Explanation: "Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz means one oscillation per second."
```

**2. Match the Pairs:**
```
Textbook:
A: Flute → 1: Vibrations in air

AI Tutor MCQ:
Question: "Which instrument produces sound through vibrations in the air?"
Options: ["Tabla", "Flute", "Sitar", "Veena"]
Correct: "B" (Flute)
Explanation: "Flute creates sound by vibrating the air column inside it."
```

**3. Give Scientific Reasons:**
```
Textbook: "Why did people listen for trains by putting ear to rail?"

AI Tutor MCQ:
Question: "In earlier times, people listened for distant trains by putting their ear to the rail because:"
Options: [
  "Sound travels faster in solids than in air",
  "Rails amplify sound",
  "It was a tradition",
  "Rails are always vibrating"
]
Correct: "A"
Explanation: "Sound travels much faster through solid materials (like metal rails) compared to air, so the train's vibrations reach faster through the rail."
```

### Answer Explanation Format

**Structure:**
1. State the correct answer
2. Explain WHY it's correct (concept)
3. Optional: Why other options are wrong

**Example:**
"Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). One Hertz means one complete oscillation happens in one second. Decibel (dB) measures sound level, not frequency."
